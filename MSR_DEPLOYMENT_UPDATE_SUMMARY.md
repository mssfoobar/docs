# MSR Deployment Documentation Update Summary

## Changes Made (Final Version)

### Revision Updates
- **Combined cleanup service into MSR Backend Application**: The cleanup functionality is now correctly documented as part of the MSR Backend Application rather than a separate service
- **Moved troubleshooting to FAQ section**: Deployment-specific troubleshooting content has been moved to the FAQ section for better organization

## Original Changes

### 1. Added Critical PostgreSQL Requirements

#### In `docs/versioned/modules/msr/deployment/deployment.mdx`:

**Added comprehensive PostgreSQL WAL configuration requirements:**
- Documented the requirement for `wal_level=logical` setting
- Provided configuration examples for both startup command and postgresql.conf
- Added warning about database restart requirements

**Added Table REPLICA IDENTITY requirements:**
- Documented the need for `REPLICA IDENTITY FULL` on tracked tables
- Explained why FULL is required for MSR (complete row data capture)
- Provided SQL examples for configuration

**Added Database User Permission requirements:**
- Listed required privileges (REPLICATION, SELECT, CREATE)
- Provided SQL grant statements

### 2. Added Comprehensive Deployment Architecture Diagram

Created a detailed Mermaid diagram showing:
- Source systems with PostgreSQL WAL configuration
- CDC pipeline components (Debezium, Redpanda, Kafka Connect)
- MSR core components (TimescaleDB, Backend, Cleanup Service)
- Frontend integration via modlet
- Supporting services (IAMs, Redpanda Console)
- Data flow between all components

### 3. Enhanced Deployment Steps

**Added "Prepare Source Databases" section:**
- Step-by-step guide for WAL configuration
- Example Docker Compose configuration with `wal_level=logical`
- Preparation script template for setting REPLICA IDENTITY
- Verification queries to confirm proper setup

**Added "Configure Debezium Connectors" section:**
- Complete source connector configuration example
- Complete sink connector configuration example
- Configuration tips and best practices
- Explanation of required parameters

### 4. Enhanced Troubleshooting Section

Added common deployment issues and solutions:
- PostgreSQL WAL level not set
- REPLICA IDENTITY not configured
- Replication slot issues
- Connector configuration problems
- Detailed checklist for debugging

### 5. Updated Kafka Connect Configuration Documentation

#### In `docs/versioned/modules/msr/configuration/kafka-connect.mdx`:

**Enhanced prerequisites section:**
- Added PostgreSQL WAL configuration as critical requirement
- Expanded REPLICA IDENTITY explanation with comparison of modes
- Added database user permissions requirements
- Included verification queries and configuration examples

## Key Information Now Documented

1. **PostgreSQL WAL Level Requirement**: Clearly states that `wal_level=logical` is mandatory for Debezium CDC
2. **REPLICA IDENTITY FULL Requirement**: Explains that tables must have `REPLICA IDENTITY FULL` for complete row capture
3. **Deployment Architecture**: Visual diagram showing all components and data flow
4. **Step-by-Step Setup**: Clear progression from database preparation to final deployment
5. **Troubleshooting Guide**: Common issues and their solutions
