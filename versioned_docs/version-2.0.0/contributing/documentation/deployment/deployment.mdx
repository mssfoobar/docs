# What should the deployment folder contain?

This folder is a catch-all section to put all development-related docs for your module. Examples of what should be here:

1. What all the deployment configurations are, and how to set them - for example, what are all the environment variables
   for your service.
2. What does each configuration option do?
3. Recommended values under different circumstances, especially recommendations for production settings.

**As always, if you need to split your deployment information up into multiple files, feel free to add more files
to this section.**
