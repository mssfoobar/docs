# Configuration

Most modules will have some form of configuration, which should be specified in this section.
Configurations are usually specified using environment variables, configuration maps, runtime flags, configuration
servers etc.

For simple configuration options, they should be clearly enumerated here in a table. If a table is not ideal to display
your configuration options, you may use other alternatives as long as the expected type, default, and description is
included.

**As always, if you need to split your configuration information up into multiple files, feel free to add more files
to this section.**

## Example Configuration Table

The following is an example of configuration rendered using a markdown table - this is good for config maps in JSON/YAML
where the data type might matter:

| Name        | Type       | Default                 | Description                                                    |
| ----------- | ---------- | ----------------------- | -------------------------------------------------------------- |
| `title`     | `string`   | `'Sample Config Title'` | The title that is displayed for your this example application. |
| `outputDir` | `string`   | `'./'`                  | The path to output something from this example application.    |
| `isSecure`  | `boolean`  | `false`                 | Set to true if you want your example application to be secure. |
| `friends`   | `string[]` | `[]`                    | The list of friends you wish you had.                          |
| `enemies`   | `string[]` | `[ "Jon Snow"]`         | The list of enemies you currently have.                        |

For environment variables, the `type` column can be omitted as they are always strings.

### Example usage in JSON:

```js
{
    "title": "Sample Config Title",
    "outputDir": "./",
    "isSecure": false,
    "friends": [],
    "enemies": [ "Jon Snow" ]
}
```

### Example usage in YAML:

```YAML
title: Sample Config Title
outputDir: ./
isSecure: false
friends: []
enemies:
    - Jon Snow
```

## Example using markdown headers

For more complex configurations that require longer descriptions, you should segregate them with markdown headers. The
advantage of using markdown headers is that it also creates anchor links you can use to share directly to the
section like this for [title](#title):

### `title`

-   #### Type: `string`
-   #### Default: `'Sample'`
-   The title that is displayed for your this example application. This longer example might include an image of
    how the title looks like:

import sampleImage from "@site/static/img/sample.png";

<div class="centerize" style={{ marginBottom: "2rem", maxWidth: "325px" }}>
	<Image img={sampleImage} />
</div>

### `outputDir`

-   #### Type: `string`
-   #### Default: `'./'`
-   The path to output something from this example application.

### `isSecure`

-   #### Type: `boolean`
-   #### Default: `false`
-   Set to true if you want your example application to be secure.

    :::caution
    In some cases you might also need to call include admonitions like this, which won't fit in a table.
    :::

### `friends`

-   #### Type: `string[]`
-   #### Default: `[]`
-   The list of friends you wish you had.

You might need to elaborate on your configuration, like how you wish you were friends with Princess Diana or Jeremy
Clarkson. In which case you should pass in `[ 'Princess Diana', 'Philomena Cunk' ]` in this example.

### `enemies`

-   #### Type: `string[]`
-   #### Default: `[ 'Jon Snow' ]`
-   The list of friends you wish you had.

The list of enemies you currently have.
