# Development

This folder is a catch-all section to put all development-related docs for your module. Examples of what should be here:

1. The concepts your module introduces, such as how it operates, what entities in introduces, what are the relationship
   between these entities (e.g. an ER diagram would be very useful here).
2. More installation and setup instructions if necessary (outside of the quickstart).
3. Recipes and examples on how to use your module - concrete sample code.

**For the `development` section, it's highly likely that you'll need to split the documentation up into multiple files;
please feel free to add more files to this section.**
