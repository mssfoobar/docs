# Routes Folder

Contains the different frontend routes for the application follows
[web-base](/docs/modules/web-base/overview/overview.md) template structure. For the IAN module we will only work with the `routes/(private)/aoh/ian/api` folder and 
the `routes/(private)/_example` folder.

The `routes/(private)/_example` folder mainly for using the IAN components to debug or testing. On the other hand, the `api` folder will be responsible for handle
the API processing on server.

:::info
Refer to this [guide](https://svelte.dev/docs/kit/routing#server) for more info about api route file used in the `api` folder
