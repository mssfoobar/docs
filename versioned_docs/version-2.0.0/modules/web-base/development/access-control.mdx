# Access Control

## Authentication

Web authentication is handled as part of the framework; we pass authentication results down as a `locals` object, giving
you control over how to use them throughout the lifecycle of a request.

```typescript title="+layout.server.ts"
export async function load({ locals }) {
	const authResult = locals.authResult;

	if (authResult.success) {
		log.debug("User is authenticated");

		return {
			user: authResult.claims,
		};
	} else {
		log.debug("User is not authenticated, but since this is a public route, we allow the user anyway");
	}
}
```

You may simply access the `locals.authResult` object in your layouts or pages to determine if a user is authenticated.
It also contains all claims from the JWT, allowing you to perform any additional checks and guards you want in your
pages or layouts.

## The `AuthResult` Object

The AuthResult type can represent two possible outcomes: `AuthResultSuccess` and `AuthResultFail`.

```typescript title="auth.ts"
type AuthResult = AuthResultSuccess | AuthResultFail;

type AuthResultSuccess = {
	success: true;
	claims: AuthClaims;
	access_token?: string;
};

type AuthResultFail = {
	success: false;
};
```

### `AuthResultSuccess`

**AuthResultSuccess** indicates a successful authentication and provides:

-   A boolean `success` field that is always true, representing a successful authentication.
-   The user claims decoded from the access token (as provided by **Keycloak**).
-   The original access token itself, that can be used to make API requests to other backend services.

### `AuthResultFail`

**AuthResultFail** indicates a failed authentication and contains a boolean `success` field that is always set to false,
representing a failed authentication

:::note
This typing is to allow type narrowing to remind developers that `claims` and `access_token` are only available when
the user is authenticated.

## Guarding Routes

### Simple Authentication-Based Protection

As the resulting authentication information is made available to your application through the locals object. It can
be checked through the layout, pages, or even passed all the way to the browser to allow you to add conditional
rendering logic (e.g., displaying user names, showing/hiding content based on login status, etc).

```typescript title="+server.ts"
export const GET: RequestHandler = async ({ locals, fetch, url }) => {
	// Access the user id from the authentication result.
	const user_id: string = locals.authResult.claims.sub;

	// Construct headers and passing the access token into the header using the result.
	const headers: HeaderInit = {
		Authentication: "Bearer" + locals.authResult.access_token,
	};

	// Call api...
	const response = await fetch(url, {
		headers,
	});
};
```

### Permission-based Protection

You can perform more than just simple successful / unsuccessful authentication guards, for example, you might want to
enforce role-based access control directly within your API route handlers (which you can do so by checking the claims,
as the role information is available there), or even make an API call to the IAMS-AAS service to check if the user
is authorized to access a specific resource.

The following sample is how you might want to guard access to a specific page based on a user's permissions:

```typescript title="+page.server.ts"
import type { PageServerLoad } from "./$types";
import { redirect } from "@sveltejs/kit";

const IAMS_AAS_URL = `http://iams-aas.example.com`;

export const load: PageServerLoad = async ({ fetch, locals }) => {
	// highlight-start
	// Guard to redirect user on authentication failure
	if (!locals.authResult.success) {
		redirect(307, "/example_unauthorized_page");
	}
	// highlight-end

	const tenant_id = locals.authResult.claims.tenant_id;
	const user_id = locals.authResult.claims.user_id;
	const resource_name = "example_resource";
	const scope_name = "example_scope";

	// IAMS_AAS policy evaluation endpoint to determine if
	// this user has access to a specific resource
	const url = `${IAMS_AAS_URL}/admin/tenants/\
		${tenant_id}/users/\
		${user_id}/resources-by-name/\
		${resource_name}/scopes-by-name/\
		${scope_name}/evaluate`;

	const response = await fetch(url, {
		headers: {
			Authorization: `Bearer example_nonsense_token`,
		},
	});

	const result = await response.json();

	// highlight-start
	// Guard to redirect user on authorization failure (permission denied)
	if (result !== "PERMIT") {
		redirect(307, "/example_unauthorized_page");
	}
	// highlight-end

	return {};
};
```

:::note
The same pattern can be applied to non-page (API) routes.
