# Logger

Web logging has the complication of segregating logs that are run on the web server vs. on the browser. To standardize
logging, we've created a simple custom library which wraps the `Pino` logger with specific configurations. One important
function of our logger is to detect when the application is in production mode and prevent logging in the browser.

## What is Pino, and why have we chosen it?

`Pino` is a Node.js logger that uses minimum resources for logging.

Using minimum resources for logging is very important. Log messages tend to get added over time and this can lead to a
throttling effect on applications – such as reduced requests per second. Pino claims to be over `5x` faster than
alternatives.

See the [Benchmarks](https://getpino.io/#/docs/benchmarks) for comparisons.

There are many logging libraries out there such as `Winston` and `Bunyan`. However, we chose `Pino` over them as it is
very **low overhead**, and is has the ability to log on the browser, which is something Winston is not designed to do.
It is highly preferrable for any web Typescript code to be isomorphic as we use Svelte Kit (the same code is expected to
run on both the browser and the server/Node.js)

## Installation

### Web Base

By default, the `Web Base` already has the logger installed and should not require additional configuration for
development.

```bash title="Logger location"
.
├── aoh
│   └── core
│       .
│       ├── logger
.       .   └── Logger.ts
```

This `Logger.ts` file simply imports the logger from `@mssfoobar/logger/Logger` and re-exports it as a Svelte store.

:::warning
Do not modify the code in these files unless you are absolutely sure of what you're doing.
:::

### Other NodeJS Contexts

If you want to use the logger in a separate project (not the `Web Base`), you can install it via:

```
npm install @mssfoobar/logger
```

You can now use the logger simply by importing it and using it in your typescript or Svelte files:

Example:

```html title="example.svelte"
<script lang="ts">
	import { logger as aohLogger, type AohLogger } from "@mssfoobar/logger/Logger";
	logger.info("I'm a fancy logger!");
</script>
```

We also recommend attaching additional attributes to the logger to provide more context as to where the log is
coming from:

```html title="example_with_more_context.svelte"
<script lang="ts">
	import { logger as aohLogger, type AohLogger } from "@mssfoobar/logger/Logger";

	// Create a 'child' logger that also appends the pathname under "src" and assign it to `log`
	const log = logger.child({ src: new URL(import.meta.url).pathname });
	log.debug("This output of this logger will now also include the pathname of this file!");
</script>
```

---

## Usage

The logger is really just wraps the Pino logger, whose API you can view
[here](https://github.com/pinojs/pino/blob/main/docs/api.md).

### Using the logger in the web base

When using the logger (in the web-base), import the logger from the store and log away:

```html title="use_the_store.svelte"
<script lang="ts">
	import { logger } from "$lib/aoh/core/logger/Logger";

	const log = logger.child({ src: new URL(import.meta.url).pathname });

	log.debug("This output of this logger will not also include the pathname of this file!");
</script>
```

Note that due to a bug with Pino, when logging objects with the variadic arguments, you need to place your objects as
the first argument, and put the string message later:

```html title="add_extra_objects.svelte"
<script lang="ts">
	import { logger } from "$lib/aoh/core/logger/Logger";

	const log = logger.child({ src: new URL(import.meta.url).pathname });

	let example_object = {
		hello: "World",
	};

	let other_object = {
		cards_in_a_deck: 52,
	};

	log.debug({ example_object, other_object }, "I just logged a bunch of objects...");
</script>
```

### Logger configuration via `NODE_ENV`

The extra configuration apply over the Pino API is that the log levels are fixed, and set via the `NODE_ENV`. The
logger is set to only run in the following 3 different log levels:

-   trace
-   info
-   silent

These should not be configured manually, the appropriate log level will be chosen based on whether the logger is running
in the browser, or NodeJS, and based on the `NODE_ENV`

-   When your `NODE_ENV` is either "development" or "preview", the log level will be set to `trace`.
-   When your `NODE_ENV` is "staging", the log level will be set to `info`.
-   When your `NODE_ENV` is "production", the log level will be set to `info` on NodeJS and `silent` in the browser.
-   When your `NODE_ENV` is "silent", the log level will be forced to `silent` everywhere.
