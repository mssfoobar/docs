# Overview

UCS services are configured using toml files. To supply the configuration files to the service, use `-c` flag while
running the service.

```bash
./room-mgmt -c ./room-mgmt.toml
```

UCS services can be configured using environment variables as well. In the case of both toml file and environment
variables being used, the environment variables will take precedence.

For example, using env in sensitive information, you can override it like below:

```toml
[sql]
host = "localhost"
port = "5432"
user = "" # empty or remove
password = "" # empty or remove
```

Environment variables equivalent to toml variable `[sql]user` & `[sql]password` are `SQL_USER` & `SQL_PASSWORD`
respectively.
```dotenv
SQL_USER=postgres
SQL_PASSWORD=postgres
```
