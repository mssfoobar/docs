# Routes Folder

Contains the different frontend routes for the application follows
[web-base](/docs/modules/web-base/overview/overview.md) template structure. For the UNH module we will only work with
these two folders `routes/(private)/aoh/unh` and `routes/(public)/aoh/unh`

## Private Routes

Restricted to authenticated users and require proper authentication to access. Most of the routes and URL paths that
users can access will be inside this folder.

Refer to this [guide](https://svelte.dev/docs/kit/routing) for more info about route file used in this folder
:::

## Public Routes

Accessible to all users without authentication. On certain client-side pages, rather than calling the backend API
directly, requests will be made to this API route inside `routes/(public)/aoh/unh/api` folder, allowing it to handle
the API processing on server.
