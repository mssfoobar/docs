# Overview

This section serves as a reference point for common setup instructions across all modules. For example,
how to access our release packages, or how to set up `Docker` or `Podman` for local development.

If you're looking to run AGIL Ops Hub modules locally, you will need to read through this entire `Get Started` section to understand:

1. [What type of packages are available to you](./release-packages.mdx)
2. [How should you set up access to these packages](./access.mdx)
3. [What tools you need and should use](./tools.mdx)
4. [How to set up a local development environment](local-development.mdx)
