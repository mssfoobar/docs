# Configuration

## Using compose.override.yml to customize container settings

The `compose.override.yml` file is used to override the default settings in the `./wfe/compose.yml` file. For 
example, if you are developing activity you need to port forward Database port and Temporal api port.

Below is an example of `compose.overwrite.yml` that map the Database port 5432 to Host port 5432 and Temporal API
port 7233 to Host port 7233.

:::tip
If you are developing an activity, you will need to configure this.
:::

```yaml
name: aoh
services:
  wfe-db:
    ports:
      - 5432:5432
  temporal:
    ports:
      - 7233:7233
```

To run the docker compose file with the override file, run the following command:

```bash
docker compose --env-file .env -f wfe/compose.yml -f compose.override.yml --profile docker up -d
```
