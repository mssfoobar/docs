# Workflow Engine
Deployment configurations of the WFE components are up to the project to configure and deploy to suitable environment.
This guide describe the sample deployment configuration for WFE modules.

## IAC Sample Deployments

### Workflow Engine

```yaml
apiVersion: apps/v1
kind: Deployment
metadata:
  name: workflow-engine
  labels:
    app: workflow-engine
spec:
  replicas: 1
  selector:
    matchLabels:
      app: workflow-engine
  template:
    metadata:
      labels:
        app: workflow-engine
    spec:
      containers:
      - name: workflow-engine
        image: ghcr.io/mssfoobar/wfe/wfe-wfe:latest
        command: [ "/app/workflow-engine" ]
```

### Workflow Manager

```yaml
apiVersion: apps/v1
kind: Deployment
metadata:
  name: workflow-manager
  labels:
    app: workflow-manager
spec:
  replicas: 1
  selector:
    matchLabels:
      app: workflow-manager
  template:
    metadata:
      labels:
        app: workflow-manager
    spec:
      containers:
      - name: workflow-manager
        image: ghcr.io/mssfoobar/wfe/wfe-wfm:latest
        command: [ "/app/workflow-manager" ]
```

### Workflow Worker

```yaml
apiVersion: apps/v1
kind: Deployment
metadata:
  name: workflow-worker
  labels:
    app: workflow-worker
spec:
  replicas: 1
  selector:
    matchLabels:
      app: workflow-worker
  template:
    metadata:
      labels:
        app: workflow-worker
    spec:
      containers:
      - name: workflow-worker
        image: ghcr.io/mssfoobar/wfe/wfe-wfw:latest
        command: [ "/app/workflow-worker" ]
```

### Workflow Designer

```yaml
apiVersion: apps/v1
kind: Deployment
metadata:
  name: workflow-designer
  labels:
    app: workflow-designer
spec:
  replicas: 1
  selector:
    matchLabels:
      app: workflow-designer
  template:
    metadata:
      labels:
        app: workflow-designer
    spec:
      containers:
      - name: workflow-designer
        image: ghcr.io/mssfoobar/wfe/wfe-wfd:latest
        command: [ "node", "build" ]
```

## Configuring for Production

### Securing Endpoints
Only WFM & WFD needs to be exposed outside of Kubernetes Cluster to access designer web and workflow manager API
endpoints. The rest of the WFE components should not be exposed outside of Kubernetes Cluster.

Temporal service comes with Web UI to debug workflow execution. It can be exposed outside of Kubernetes Cluster for
debugging purpose.

### Scaling
All WFE components are horizontally scalable. WFM & WFD can be load balanced through Ingress Controller/Load Balancer.
The rest of the WFE components load balancing is handled by Temporal Service.
