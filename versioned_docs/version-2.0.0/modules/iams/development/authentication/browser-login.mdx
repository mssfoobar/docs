# Browser Login using OpenID Connect - Authorization Code Flow with Proof Key for Code Exchange (PKCE)

OpenID Connect is a simple identity layer built on top of the OAuth 2.0 protocol, which allows clients to verify the identity of an end user based on the authentication 
performed by an authorization server or identity provider (IdP, such as Keycloak), as well as to obtain basic profile information about the end user in an 
interoperable and REST-like manner.

OpenID Connect specifies a RESTful HTTP API, using JSON as a data format.

For more information on OpenID, please refer to the following link:
[https://openid.net/developers/how-connect-works/](https://openid.net/developers/how-connect-works/)

AGIL Ops Hub Web Framework is using Authorization Code Flow with Proof Key for Code Exchange (PKCE) to perform user authentication, which is more secure than the 
Implicit Flow as the Client Secret is not longer required, which limits exposure to reverse engineering.

The following flow chart depicts how the PKCE work:

:::note
AGIL Ops Hub Web Framework handle the whole flow depicted below. Project just need to perform the necessary configuration and don’t need to implement the flow
:::

import login from "@site/static/img/modules/iams/development/authentication/browser-login/login.jpg";

<div  class="centerize" >
    <div style={{ marginBottom: "2rem", maxWidth: "600px" }}>
        <Image img={login} />
    </div>
</div>

1. User make request to `Web App Backend` (based on `AGIL Ops Hub Web Base`). If the request is to a resource that require login and user is not login yet, 
the Web App Backend will initiate the authentication process with the Keycloak.

To prepare for the authentication process, AGIL Ops Hub `Web Base` will perform the followings:

-   creates a cryptographically-random `code_verifier`
-   derives a `code_challenge` from `code_verified` using `S256` hash function

2. Web App Backend then redirect the user to the Keycloak server along with the `code_challenge`. Other information that are send along are:

-   **client_id** – client id of the Web App Backend at `Keycloak` (see next section on how to configure client in Keycloak)
-   **scope** – used to specify the scope of the requested authorisation. Typical scopes are `openid`, `email`, and `profile`.
-   **response_type** – set to code to indicate an authorisation code flow.
-   **redirect_uri** – callback URI for the authentication response
-   **code_challenge** – the string derived from the code verifier
-   **code_challenge_method** – set to `S256` to specific that the method used to derive the code challenge

3. After verifying the supplied information sent by Web App Backend, Keycloak will redirect user to the Keycloak Login screen.

4. User then proceed with log in to Keycloak using his/her credential. Depend on the setup, user may be prompt additional action to complete the login process, 
such as enter TOTP password, change password, etc.

5. After User successfully completed the login process with Keycloak, Keycloak will generate an `authorization code` and associate it with the `code_challenge`. 
Keycloak then redirect user back to Web App Backend using the specified redirect URI specified in step 2 together with the `authorization code`.

6. The Web App Backend will then send Keycloak `authorization code` and `code_verifier` (generated in step 1) to exchange for the `ID token`, `access token`, 
and `refresh token` via back channel communication (i.e., direct connection from Web App Backend to Keycloak in the server side). 
See next section for information on those tokens.

Once, Keycloak successfully verified the `code_challenge` (sent in step 2) and `code_verifier`, it will respond with an `ID token`, `access token`, and `refresh token` which 
can be used to authenticate the user and access protected resources.

7. Web App Backend will then store the `access token`, and `refresh token` in the user browser cookies.

:::note
AGIL Ops Hub `Web Base` only store `access token` and `refresh token` in cookies. 
`ID Token` is not stored as the information in `ID Token` can also be found in `access token`.
:::

8. Any further request to Web App Backend will then be accompanied by the cookies containing the `access token`, and `refresh token` which Web App Backend 
can use to identify the user.

9. If the user request required invoking backend microservices, the Web App Backend will then pass on the `access token` in the service request (in 
the `authorization` header) to allow backend microservices to authorize the original caller.

## Configuration

For Web App Backend to handle the login flow, the following settings need to be configured in the `.env` file:

-   **IAM_URL** – this is the URL to the Keycloak. The URL is in the following format:


<CodeBlock language="bash">
  {`http(s)://`}
  <span className="highlight">keycloak URL</span>
  {`/realms/`}
  <span className="highlight">realm-name</span>
</CodeBlock>

where <span className="highlight">keycloak URL</span> is the URL to the Keycloak server and <span className="highlight">realm-name</span> is the name 
of the realm.

For the `dev-container` setup, the url will be:
`http://iams-keycloak.127.0.0.1.nip.io/realms/aoh`


-   **IAM_CLIENT_ID** – of the Web App Backend at Keycloak.

The following steps register Web App Backend with Keycloak:

1. Login to Keycloak Admin Console and switch to the realm.

2. Click on `Clients` in the side menu

3. Click on `Create client` button

![Create Client](/img/modules/iams/development/authentication/browser-login/create-client.png)

4. Fill up the following field in the `Create client` form:

-   Client type – OpenID Connect
-   Client ID – unique id to identify the Web App Backend. To be same as `IAM_CLIENT_ID`

5. Click on `Next` button:

![Next](/img/modules/iams/development/authentication/browser-login/next.png)

6. Click on `Next` again.

8. Add the redirect URL to the `Valid redirect URIs` field. The redirect URL is the URL that you want Keycloak to redirect user to after user has successful login to Keycloak.
   Keycloak accept wildcard character in the URI.

9. Add the `Web origins` that is allowed for the redirect.

10. Click on `Save` button to complete the creation.
