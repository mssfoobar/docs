# IAMS

All the APIs request to UCS are authenticated using IAMS. For deployment of IAMS, please refer to its
[deployment guide](../../iams/deployment/overview.md).

## Keycloak client for Room-Sentry

Internally, Room-Sentry calls Signal service to manage room states. To allow Room-Sentry to call Signal service, you
need to create a new client for Room-Sentry to generate access token.

After deploying IAMS in your Kubernetes cluster, you can access its admin console to create a new client.

1. Login to Keycloak Admin Console and switch the realm. This example demonstrates using AOH realm.

-   Leave the fields below empty and click on `Save`.

4. You have created a new client in AOH-IAMS. Go to the `Credentials` tab in the client details page and take note of
   the client id and client secret which will be needed in UCS deployment.
