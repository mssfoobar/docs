# Pre-requisites

The following section assumes you have installed all the tools required for web development from our
[tools section](../../get-started/tools.mdx).

Before you move on, it is also **mandatory** that you read through the key technology list in our
[web technologies](/overview/technologies/web.md) section and you understand the justification for each one,
especially if you're not familiar with the specific technology.

:::info
It is presumed that you already have a `Web Base` prepared and ready for you install modlets, otherwise, please go to the
[Web Framework quickstart section](../../web-base/quickstart/quickstart.mdx) to initialize your
`Web Base`.

It is also presumed that you are already familiar with running a local development environment, otherwise, please go to
the [Local Dev Environment](../../get-started/local-development.mdx) to prepare your machine for local
development.
:::

## Installation

### 1. CLI tool installation of `UCS` Modlet

Navigate to the `web` folder in your `Web Base` and run the following command:

```bash title="web-base/web"
npx cli install ucs
```

:::info
If "cli" is an unknown command, you might have to run `npx cli` instead of `cli` or, run `npm install` first, because
the CLI tool might not already be in your global or local `node_modules` folder.
:::

You'll then be prompted to choose your 'root folder', use the default (current working directory).

Follow the CLI tool's instructions. the modlet will be installed, with the appropriate files being copied over, and
dependencies will be added and copied into your package.json.

#### 1.1 Move the new environment variables to your template

The CLI tool appends new environment variables used by the modlet into your `.env.template` file, if you've already set
up your `.env` file, you should manually copy these values over. Otherwise, you can use the entire defaults by copying
the template file and renaming it to `.env`.

```bash title="web-base/web"
cp .env.template .env
```

### 2. Manual installation of `UCS` Modlet

The `UCS` has extra steps that are already automatically executed by the CLI tool. If you've chosen `no` during the
setup stage of the CLI tool, or wish to know what the tool actually did, you can refer to the following:

#### 2.1 Add the following properties to your `.env` file

These default values will work if you're using `127.0.0.1.nip.io` for development, otherwise, change them accordingly.
The specifics for what each environment variable does can be found in the
[configuration section](../configuration/configuration.mdx#modlet-environment-variables).

```bash title=".env" {5,8,11}
...

## ==================== UCS ====================
## The URL to the UCS backend service
PUBLIC_UCS_SIGNAL_URL=http://ucs-signal.127.0.0.1.nip.io
## The URL to the UCS signal service
UCS_URL=http://ucs.127.0.0.1.nip.io

## We know this is confusing, at the moment they are both used by different modlets (IAM vs IAMS)
## So you MUST include both though they are pointing to the same service, we need the IAMS as to 
## retrieve all possible users to be contacted.
IAM_AAS_URL=http://iams-aas.127.0.0.1.nip.io
IAMS_AAS_URL=http://iams-aas.127.0.0.1.nip.io
```

### 3. Run the local environment required for UCS development

```bash title="dev-containers"
podman compose --env-file .env -f ucs/compose.yml up -d
```

:::tip
Remeber to adjust and add the `compose.override.yml` if you're using Docker, or have other requirements like exposing
the database for direct connection from database management tool.
:::

### 4. Start the development server

```bash
npm run dev
```
