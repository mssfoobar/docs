# Configuration

In a production environment, your application server and backend services would typically be run containerized in a
Docker or Kubernetes context. As such, environment variables would usually be set by your `Docker Compose` files,
or `Kubernetes` deployment manifests.

## Modlet Environment Variables

This section covers `IMS` specific modlet environment variables. The `Web Base` environment variables still apply.

| Environment Variable            | Example Value                 |
| ------------------------------- | ----------------------------- |
| [`IMS_ENDPOINT`](#ims_endpoint) | `http://ims.127.0.0.1.nip.io` |

### `IMS_ENDPOINT`

<details>
	<summary>The base URL of the backend IMS service</summary>
	<div>
		This URL is used by the frontend modlet (running in the browser or on the server-side during rendering) to make
		API calls to the backend IMS service (the Go application).
	</div>
</details>

## Service Environment Variables

The `IMS` backend service is a Golang application. This section covers the specific environment variables used to
configure its runtime behavior, database connection, and authentication settings.

| Environment Variable                              | Example Value                                                                       |
| ------------------------------------------------- | ----------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| [`APP_PORT`](#app_port)                           | `5001`                                                                              |
| [`LOG_LEVEL`](#log_level)                         | `debug`                                                                             |

| [`SQL_USER`](#sql_user)                           | `postgres`                                                                          |
| [`SQL_PASSWORD`](#sql_password)                   | `postgres`                                                                          |
| [`SQL_PLUGIN_NAME`](#sql_plugin_name)             | `postgresql`                                                                        |
| [`SQL_DATABASE_NAME`](#sql_database_name)         | `ims`                                                                               |
| [`SQL_SCHEMA`](#sql_schema)                       | `ims`                                                                               |

| [`SQL_MAX_IDLE_CONNS`](#sql_max_idle_conns)       | `5`                                                                                 |
| [`SQL_MAX_CONN_LIFETIME`](#sql_max_conn_lifetime) | `300`                                                                               |
| [`IAM_URL`](#iam_url)                             | `http://iams-keycloak.127.0.0.1.nip.io/realms/aoh/protocol/openid-connect/userinfo` |

### `APP_PORT`

<details>
	<summary>The port on which the IMS backend service listens for requests</summary>
	<div>
		This variable defines the network port that the Golang HTTP server will bind to. API requests from the frontend
		(`IMS_ENDPOINT`) should be directed to this port (often through an ingress or proxy).
	</div>
</details>

### `LOG_LEVEL`

<details>
	<summary>Controls the verbosity of application logging</summary>
	<div>
		Sets the minimum level for log messages that will be outputted (e.g., `debug`, `info`, `warn`, `error`). `debug`
		is typically the most verbose level, useful for development.
	</div>
</details>

### `SQL_HOST`

<details>
	<summary>The hostname or IP address of the database server</summary>
	<div>Specifies the location of the PostgreSQL database server that the IMS service needs to connect to.</div>
</details>

### `SQL_PORT`

<details>
	<summary>The port on which the database server is listening</summary>
	<div>The network port for the PostgreSQL database connection. The default for PostgreSQL is typically `5432`.</div>
</details>

### `SQL_USER`

<details>
	<summary>The username for authenticating with the database</summary>
	<div>
		The database user account that the IMS service will use to establish a connection. Ensure this user has the
		necessary permissions on the target database and schema.
	</div>
</details>

### `SQL_PASSWORD`

<details>
	<summary>The password for authenticating with the database</summary>
	<div>
		The password corresponding to the `SQL_USER`. It's recommended to manage this securely (e.g., using Kubernetes
		Secrets or Docker Swarm Secrets).
	</div>
</details>

### `SQL_PLUGIN_NAME`

<details>
	<summary>Specifies the database driver or type to use</summary>
	<div>
		Indicates the type of SQL database being connected to, allowing the application to use the correct Go database
		driver. In this case, `postgresql`.
	</div>
</details>

### `SQL_DATABASE_NAME`

<details>
	<summary>The name of the database to connect to</summary>
	<div>
		Specifies the target database name within the PostgreSQL server instance defined by `SQL_HOST` and `SQL_PORT`.
	</div>
</details>

### `SQL_SCHEMA`

<details>
	<summary>The database schema to use for tables</summary>
	<div>
		Defines the PostgreSQL schema where the IMS application's tables reside or should be created. Using schemas
		helps namespace tables within a single database, especially in multi-tenant or multi-module scenarios. Ensure
		database migration tools (if used) are configured to use this schema.
	</div>
</details>

### `SQL_MAX_CONNS`

<details>
	<summary>The maximum number of open connections to the database</summary>
	<div>
		Controls the size of the database connection pool. This limits the total number of connections (both in-use and
		idle) the service can open simultaneously. This value should be set carefully, considering the database server's
		`max_connections` limit and the number of service replicas.
	</div>
</details>

### `SQL_MAX_IDLE_CONNS`

<details>
	<summary>The maximum number of connections kept idle in the pool</summary>
	<div>
		Specifies how many established database connections should be kept open and waiting in the pool, even when not
		actively used. This can improve performance by reducing the latency of acquiring a new connection. This value
		should be less than or equal to `SQL_MAX_CONNS`.
	</div>
</details>

### `SQL_MAX_CONN_LIFETIME`

<details>
	<summary>The maximum time (in seconds) a connection can be reused</summary>
	<div>
		Sets the maximum duration for which a connection can be kept open and reused in the pool. After this time, the
		connection will be closed and potentially reopened when needed. This helps in gracefully handling database
		restarts, network changes, or load balancer configurations. The value `300` represents 5 minutes.
	</div>
</details>

### `IAM_URL`

<details>
	<summary>The URL to the Identity Provider's userinfo endpoint for token validation</summary>
	<div>
		This URL is used by the IMS backend service to validate incoming access tokens (usually JWTs) received in API
		requests (typically in the `Authorization` header). By calling the OIDC userinfo endpoint with the received
		token, the backend can verify the token's validity and retrieve associated user information from the Identity
		Provider (Keycloak). Note that this URL is different from the `IAM_URL` used by the modlet; the service uses a
		specific endpoint for validation, while the modlet uses the discovery document URL.
	</div>
</details>
