# Operating Concept

## Recording

Recording namespace includes modules that capture and prepare data for Playback.
There are 4 modules inside Recording namespace: Debezium, ScheduleJobs, Timekeeper, and TransformMsg.

### Capturing data with Debezium, NATS and TransformMsg module
---
This section describes how changes in the `Live DB` are captured, streamed, and transformed into SQL statements for later use during Playback.

#### Step 1: Change Data Capture with Debezium

Debezium is configured to monitor the `Live DB` for real-time data changes such as `INSERT`, `UPDATE`, and `DELETE` operations.  
Once a change is detected, Debezium captures the event and emits a structured change record.

#### Step 2: Publish Events to NATS

Debezium publishes these change records to **NATS**, a lightweight messaging system.  
Each database change event becomes a NATS message, categorized by topics/subjects.

#### Step 3: TransformMsg - Preprocessing and SQL Generation

The `TransformMsg` module listens to the relevant NATS subject and performs the following tasks:

- Consumes Debezium change events
- Parses and validates the incoming data
- Converts each event into an executable SQL statement (e.g. `INSERT`, `UPDATE`, `DELETE`)

#### Step 4: Store Transformed SQL

The resulting SQL statements are saved in the `Transform Message DB`. This allows the system to reuse statements for replay database event.

### ScheduleJobs

The system includes three scheduled cron jobs to manage data lifecycle, backups, and storage:

#### Backup Job

This job handles regular backups of the `Live DB`.

**Responsibilities:**
- Takes a **snapshot** of the `Live DB`
- Uploads the snapshot file to external **storage**, such as **MinIO** or **S3**
- Inserts a metadata record into the `Live DB` that references the uploaded object (e.g. object key, path, creation time)

This ensures that each backup is both stored and traceable via the database.

---

#### Cleanup Transform Data Job

This job cleans up outdated or processed transformation data from the system.

**Responsibilities:**
- Deletes old **SQL statements** and related **RTUS API data** stored in the `Transform Message DB`
- Helps maintain a lean transformation database, ensuring high performance and storage efficiency

This cleanup ensures that only relevant transformation data is retained.

---

#### Cleanup Backup Job

This job removes outdated backup files and their metadata.

**Responsibilities:**
- Deletes **dump objects** (snapshot files) from the storage system (MinIO/S3)
- Removes corresponding **metadata records** from the `Live DB`

This keeps storage usage under control and ensures old, unneeded backups are safely purged.

---

### Timekeeper Service

The **Timekeeper** service is a core background module responsible for time-based synchronization in the system. It runs continuously, executing tasks at one-second intervals.

**Responsibilities:**
- **Update System Time:** Periodically writes the current timestamp to the `Live DB` to ensure consistent time reference across the system.
- **Notify RTUS (Real-Time Update Service):** Sends updates to the **RTUS service** every second to trigger or synchronize real-time updates in the `Live Namespace`.

This service ensures consistent and accurate timing information across all modules that rely on system time.

**Dependencies**
- **Live DB:** for storing the latest system time.
- **RTUS:** to propagate time-sensitive updates across real-time services.

---

## Playback

The **Playback namespace** consists of tightly integrated components that restore data snapshots and replay transformations to simulate a previous system state.

---

### How Playback Session Works

The `ReplayMgr` component is the **central controller** for managing the lifecycle of a playback session. It supports:

- **Init** Create a new playback session with target time range and metadata.
- **Start** Trigger the session execution by publishing an event to `EventStream`.
- **Pause** Temporarily halt the ongoing playback for inspection or delay.
- **End** Complete the session and clean up any temporary data if required.

When perform session request, `ReplayMgr` publishes a **NATS event** into `EventStream`, which signals `DBOP` to begin restoring the snapshot and `MSGOP` to later replay SQL events.

When a **user initializes a playback session**, the following sequence occurs:

1. **Session Initialization by ReplayMgr**
   - The `ReplayMgr` module creates a new playback session.
   - It publishes a **NATS event** to the `EventStream` to notify downstream processors.

2. **Data Restore by DBOP**
   - `DBOP` listens for the event from `ReplayMgr`.
   - It queries the **nearest snapshot information** based on the session start time.
   - Retrieves the corresponding **dump object** from storage (e.g., **MinIO/S3**).
   - **Restores the snapshot** into the `Playback DB`.

3. **Event Acknowledgment by DBOP**
   - After restore:
     - Publishes an **OK** or **KO** event to `EventStream` via **NATS**.
     - `OK`: Indicates successful restoration.
     - `KO`: Indicates failure and may abort session.

4. **SQL Replay by MSGOP**
   - `MSGOP` monitors the `EventStream` for **OK** events.
   - Upon success:
     - It queries SQL statements from the `TransformMsg Database`.
     - Filters them between:
       - the **restored system time** (from dump object), and
       - the **user-specified playback session start time**.
     - Executes the SQL statements in the `Playback Database`.


### Session Start Flow

When the user starts a session:

1. **ReplayMgr** publishes a `StartSession` event to **NATS (EventStream)**.

2. **MSGOP** (Message Operation Service):
   - Listens for the `StartSession` event.
   - Queries SQL statements from the **TransformMsg DB**, ranging from the session's **start time** to **end time** and executes them into the **Playback DB**.
   - Beside that, queries RTUS API from **TransformMsg DB** and makes API calls to the **RTUS** to simulate real-time behavior based on the same time range (start â†’ end).


> ðŸ’¡ This dual action by `MSGOP` ensures both data replay and real-time simulation, enriching the playback session.
