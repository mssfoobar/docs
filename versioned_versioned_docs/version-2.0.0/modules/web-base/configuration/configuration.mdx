# Configuration

The `Web Base`, has many levels of configuration available, we'll start with configuration specific to AGIL Ops Hub,
and then briefly explain the myriad of other tools that can be configured.

## Environment Variables

In a production environment, your application server would typically be run containerized in a Docker or Kubernetes
context. As such, environment variables would either be set by your `Docker Compose` files, or `Kubernetes` deployment
manifests.

However, during **development**, we manage our environment variables using a `.env` file in the root of the project.

SvelteKit (actually Vite) handles them in two ways:

-   Static: Processed during build-time and statically replaced, these cannot be changed during run-time.
-   Dynamic: These can be changed during run-time by modifying the environment variable.

Refer to the [Svelte Kit $env API](https://kit.svelte.dev/docs/modules#$env-dynamic-private) to learn how to access
these variables; code in Svelte Kit is differentiated as being available on both the client & server or server only.

:::info
Code that is exposed to the client can only import env vars that are marked `PUBLIC_` (to avoid leaking sensitive
information to the browser). The full list of environment variables are available in the `.env.template` file
:::

If you need to add more variables to the `.env` file, remember to update the `.env.template` and the
`docker-compose.yml` file's `environment` property to document the newly required variable(s).

Since Vite loads additional `.env` files based on the `NODE_ENV` (e.g. when `NODE_ENV=development`, it will load
`.env.development`), so you can easily add additional files to load and override variables by following the
`.env.[mode]` format.

:::info
Running `npm run dev` will run node with `NODE_ENV=development`.
See [Vite's official documentation](https://vitejs.dev/guide/env-and-mode.html#modes).

### `IAM_URL`

<details>
	<summary>The full OIDC issuer URL for the OIDC provider, **including the discovery suffix**</summary>
	<div>
		This is the URL to keycloak (e.g. `https://iams-keycloak.com`) plus the specific realm (e.g. `/realms/aoh` if
		your realm is called "aoh"), which is the "issuer" endpoint, plus the OIDC discovery suffix
		(`.well-known/openid-configuration`). The suffix is included to prevent the OIDC client from performing extra
		issuer checks which is a problem when separating the backchannel from front channel communication with Keycloak.
    </div>

</details>

### `IAM_CLIENT_ID`

<details>
	<summary>The OIDC Client ID used by the web application</summary>
	<div>
		This client id is a public identifier for apps specified by the OIDC standard. For each web application that
		cannot share an access token, you should have a separate client for it. You can find this ID in `Clients`
		section in your Keycloak console.

    	You can learn more about the `Client ID` and `Client Secret`
    	[here](https://www.oauth.com/oauth2-servers/client-registration/client-id-secret/).
    </div>

</details>

### `IAM_CLIENT_SECRET`

<details>
	<summary>The OIDC Client Secret used by the web application</summary>
	<div>
		For each client, a secret is required that is known only to the application and Keycloak. You can find this
		secret in the `Clients > Client details > Credentials > Client Secret` section in your Keycloak console.

    	You can learn more about the `Client ID` and `Client Secret`
    	[here](https://www.oauth.com/oauth2-servers/client-registration/client-id-secret/).
    </div>

</details>

### `PUBLIC_DOMAIN`

<details>
	<summary>The domain the web server is hosted on</summary>
	<div>
		This is currently used for setting the cookie domain, if these values are invalid, your cookies will **NOT** be
		set. Note that during development, when using `localhost` as the domain, this **must** be left blank for
		Chromium browsers.
    </div>

</details>

### `PUBLIC_COOKIE_PREFIX`

<details>
	<summary>A prefix to add to the cookies for namespacing purposes</summary>
	<div>
		The prefix to add to the cookie key for the access token, refresh token, and code verifier cookie keys, this is
		to avoid clashes when multiple web servers are deployed on the same domain.
    </div>

</details>

### `ORIGIN`

<details>
	<summary>The origin where the web server is hosted on</summary>
	<div>
		The origin must be specified for the web server to know what the origin of the front-end request is meant to be,
		it is used by SvelteKit to determine how to construct URLS when relative paths are used, and it is also used by
		our server to determine whether to store cookies in secure mode (if HTTPS is used) and how to redirect the user
		during the OIDC Authorization Code Flow.

    	Note that for development you're probably using `http://localhost:5173` or `http://127.0.0.1.nip.io`.

    	More info:
    	- [What is the origin of a URL?](https://web.dev/articles/url-parts#origin)
    	- [What is the ORIGIN env var in SvelteKit?](https://svelte.dev/docs/kit/adapter-node#Environment-variables-ORIGIN-PROTOCOL_HEADER-HOST_HEADER-and-PORT_HEADER)
    </div>

</details>

### `OIDC_ALLOW_INSECURE_REQUESTS`

<details>
	<summary>Enable this flag to bypass the OIDC client's insecure request restrictions</summary>
	<div>
		This configuration exists to warn the user that the authentication flow involves making requests over an
		insecure channel - specifically, HTTP instead of HTTPS. This is commonly required in infrastructures where TLS
		termination happens at the ingress. Since this set up is very common, we allow users to consciously bypass
		the request restrictions (instead of disabling it entirely by default). Leave this environment variable empty,
		or set to 0 if you **DO NOT** want to allow insecure requests (if you use HTTPS even through backchannel
		communications)

    	See the `openid-client`'s official documentation for more details:
    	https://github.com/panva/openid-client/blob/main/docs/functions/allowInsecureRequests.md
    </div>

</details>

### `LOGIN_DESTINATION`

<details>
	<summary>The page to send the user to **after** a successful login</summary>
	<div>
		This is like the home page of the application - it is the path to send the user to after they login
		successfully. The ORIGIN is automatically prepended to the URL. For example, if your website is at
		`http://www.my-cool-app.com` and you want to send the user to
		`http://www.my-cool-app.com/my-stepdad-beats-me/really`, you should set the `LOGIN_DESTINATION` to
		`/my-stepdad-beats-me/really`.
	</div>
</details>

### `LOGIN_PAGE`

<details>
	<summary>The page to send the user to when they're not logged in</summary>
	<div>
		This is the path the user gets thrown to when they're not logged in. The ORIGIN is automatically prepended to
		the URL. For example, if your website is at `http://www.my-cool-app.com` and you want to send the user to
		`http://www.my-cool-app.com/this-is-not-a-cry-for-help`, you should set the `LOGIN_PAGE` to
		`/this-is-not-a-cry-for-help`.
	</div>
</details>

### `PUBLIC_STATIC_BUILD_VERSION`

<details>
	<summary>Build-time env var to bake the application version information in</summary>
	<div>
		This is a static Vite variable - meaning it is set before the app is built and the values are replaced by
		strings when the application is built (so it cannot be replaced during runtime).

    	You should use this to set the build version of the application upon building it - this will allow you to have
    	a reliable way to figure out what version of the application is being run.
    </div>

</details>

### `NODE_ENV`

<details>
	<summary>Standard NodeJS environment variable</summary>
	<div>
		We utilizing the `NODE_ENV` to determine what log level to set the application to:

    	`development`:
    	`production`:
    </div>

</details>

## Config Files

Our web framework integrates many different open source packages, many of which have their own configuration files.

This scope of this section is to only elaborate on these configuration files where **necessary**. For more information,
you can follow the links to understand in-depth on how each configuration file can be configured.

:::info
A ⭐ has been added to some particularly important files that you should pay attention to.
:::

### `.changeset`

We use [changesets](/docs/stable/contributing/development/source-control#changesets) to help track changes and manage
release notes. We recommend you use `changesets` as well, otherwise, you can delete this file and remove the
`@changesets/cli` dev dependency from the package.json.

### `.husky`

Husky is a tool used to run scripts on commit events. We have a `.husky` folder that's configured to run `prettier` and
`eslint` on staged files before each commit. It also lints commit messages to esnure they follow the conventional
commits standard. This is essential for keeping code quality high, and we recommend you configure this for your own
development operations as well.

Read more about [lint-staged](https://www.npmjs.com/package/lint-staged/v/12.3.2) and
[husky](https://typicode.github.io/husky/).

### `.commitlintrc.cts`

We use commit lint to enforce
[`conventional commits`](/docs/stable/contributing/development/source-control#conventional-commits). You can remove
this configuration but we recommend you also govern how your commit messages are written to keep your messages neat,
parsable, and sensible.

Read more about [commitlint](https://commitlint.js.org/).

### `.env` ⭐

During development, it is preferrable to use the provided `.env` file (make a copy of the `.env.template` and rename it)
to set your environment variables. Refer to the [`Environment Variables`](#environment-variables) section above for
a detailed breakdown on environment variables we expect.

Note that the `.env` file will **NOT** work in production by default. The `.env` file is only loaded by Vite during
development. If you still wish to use a `.env` file, you'll have to load it by running `source .env` or using some other
method to load `.env` files (like the `env-cmd` library).

### `.npmrc`

We use an `npmrc` file to configure the registry for our scoped package (`@mssfoobar`), the default configuration
points to our package on GitHub, if you are not connecting directly to our npm package registry on GitHub, you will
have to contact your configuration manager to get the correct URL.

<CodeBlock language="bash" title="Render Output">
	<span>engine-strict=true</span>
	@mssfoobar:registry=<span className="highlight">REGISTRY URL</span>
</CodeBlock>

-   Replace <span className="highlight">REGISTRY URL</span> with the correct URL for your npm package server.

Read more about [npmrc files](https://docs.npmjs.com/cli/v9/configuring-npm/npmrc).

### `.prettierrc`

We use prettier to standardize the formatting of code - it is also integrated with husky to run on each commit. The
settings follow the default settings provided when initializing `SvelteKit` as it includes a plugin that understands
`.svelte` files.

Like many of the other tools used Prettier is not mandatory but also highly recommended.

Read more about [prettier configuration](https://prettier.io/docs/configuration).

### `aoh_colors.json`

This is a set of colours used by AGIL Ops Hub, stored as a separate `.json` file that is imported to our
[`tailwind`](#tailwindconfigts-)
configuration. This is to keep colours installed via `shadcn-svelte` segregated from our own custom colours.

### `components.json`

This configuration file is created by `shadcn-svelte`. It holds configuration information to help the
`shadcn-svelte cli tool` understand which files and folders to modify when installing or updating `shadcn-svelte`
components.

Read more about [shadcn-svelte](https://next.shadcn-svelte.com/).

### `eslint.config.js`

Our `eslint` configuration is set with our own preferences, as well as plugins rules for it to work with `.svelte`
files. We use [`husky`](#husky) to run `eslint` on our staged files using
[`lint-staged`](#packagejson--package-lockjson).

We believe linting your files regularly is critical to keeping code quality high, so we highly recommend not removing
this tool.

Read more about [eslint](https://eslint.org/).

### `package.json` & `package-lock.json`

This is how `npm` projects are configured - read more about it
[here](https://docs.npmjs.com/cli/v11/configuring-npm/package-json).

Note that the `package.json` in the `Web Base` has the `lint-staged` key used to configure `lint-staged`, which is run
by [husky](#husky).

### `playwright.config.ts`

We use playwright to automate end-to-end tests.

Read more about [playwright](https://playwright.dev/).

### `postcss.config.js`

Postcss is a dependency for [`Tailwind CSS`](#tailwindconfigts-) to run. This is mandatory and you should also never
need to change this.

### `svelte.config.js` ⭐

This file is used to configure SvelteKit-specific configuration, along with the `.env` file, this is one of
the most important configuration files. The file here simply uses the default configuration. Svelte provides
documentation on this configuration file in detail [here](https://svelte.dev/docs/kit/configuration).

### `tailwind.config.ts` ⭐

The configuration provided for `Tailwind CSS` includes integration with `iconify` via some plugins, as well as many
additional theme extensions installed via `shadcn-svelte`, and our custom `aoh_colours.json` definitions.

Read more about [Tailwind CSS](https://tailwindcss.com/).

### `tsconfig.json`

Our project uses typescript, and requires a typescript configuration file as a result. The configuration here is
somewhat typical.

Read more about [typescript configuration](https://www.typescriptlang.org/tsconfig/).

### `vite.config.js` ⭐

Vite is a powerful frontend build tool that use as it is required by Svelte Kit. It is important to understand how to
configure vite if you want to perform integrations with other frontend tools, especially if they have special
requirements, such as requiring certain static files to be present, etc.

Read more about [configuring vite](https://vite.dev/config/).
