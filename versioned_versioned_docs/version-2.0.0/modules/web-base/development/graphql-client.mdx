# GraphQL Client

## Installation

To install to your web-base. Simply use the following command in the web-base.

```
npx cli install @mssfoobar/graphql
```

Alternatively, you may want to run this,
if you want a specific version of this package.

```
npx cli install @mssfoobar/graphql@<version tag>
```

## Post Installation

After installation, there will be a new folder copied to your web-base as displayed below:

```
.
├─aoh
│   └─core
│     ...
│     ├─graphql
│     │ ├─configuration.json
│     │ └─graphql_client.ts
.     ...
```

The GraphQL Client consists of two main files:

-   `configuration.json`: This file requires the user to specify the GraphQL endpoint URL. You will need to update this
    file with your GraphQL endpoint for the client to work correctly.
-   `graphql_client.ts`: This file contains the GraphQL client instance, which is stored in a Svelte store. You can
    import and use this client in your application to execute GraphQL queries and subscriptions.

### Post-installation Setup Instructions

To use the GraphQL Client, follow these steps:

```typescript
{
  "endpoint": "<Please input your graphql server endpoint here>"
}
```

### Configuring the Protocol

You can choose between `HTTP`/`HTTPS` and `WS`/`WSS` protocols for your queries and subscriptions respectively
by setting the isSecure flag in `graphql_client.ts`. For example:

```typescript title="graphql.ts"
let gqlClient = createGraphqlClient(graphqlConfig.endpoint, {
  isSecure: true, //Set true or false depending on which protocol
...});
```

Once done, you can use the graphql client to perform your query or subscription.

## API

### `Query`

The client.query function is used to execute a GraphQL query.
Parameters

-   **client**: The GraphQL client instance. (use the graphql store imported)
-   **document**: The GraphQL subscription query.
-   **variables**: An object containing variables to pass to the subscription. (Optional)

Returns: [Urql Operation Result Source](https://commerce.nearform.com/open-source/urql/docs/api/core/#operationresult)

```typescript title="query.svelte"
import { gqlClientStore } from "./graphql_client";
import { query } from "@mssfoobar/graphql/graphql";
const ExampleQuery = gql`
	query {
		user(id: 1) {
			name
			email
		}
	}
`;

const client = $gqlClientStore;
const result = await query(client, ExampleQuery, {});
```

### `Subscribe`

The subscribe function is used to subscribe to a GraphQL subscription. It takes in a client, document, variables, and a
callback function to handle the result.

Parameters:

-   **client**: The GraphQL client instance. (use the graphql store imported)
-   **document**: The GraphQL subscription query.
-   **variables**: An object containing variables to pass to the subscription. (Optional)
-   **onResult**: A callback function to handle the result of the subscription.

Returns:

-   **Subscription**: A reference to the subscription object that you can use to unsubscribe from.

```typescript title="example.svelte"
<script lang="ts">
import { subscribe } from "./graphql";
import { gqlClientStore } from "./graphql_client"

const client = $gqlClientStore
const document = gql`
  subscription {
    newMessage {
      id
      text
    }
  }
`;

onMount(() => {
	// highlight-start
	subscribe(client, document, {}, (result) => {
		// do something with the result
		logger.debug(result.data.newMessage);
	});
	// highlight-end
});

```

### `Unsubscribe`

The unsubscribe function is used to unsubscribe from a GraphQL subscription. Normally, you would call this when the
component is destroyed.

```typescript title="Unsubscribe example.svelte"
import { unsubscribe } from "./graphql";
import { gqlClientStore } from "./graphql_client";

const client = $gqlClientStore;
const subscription = subscribe(client, document, {}, (result) => {
	logger.debug(result.data.newMessage);
});

onDestroy(() => {
	// highlight-start
	// Remember to unsubscribe when the component is being destroyed to avoid leaks
	unsubscribe(subscription);
	// highlight-end
});
```

## Recommended Usage

Since the GraphQL spec official supports introspection, there are many tools that help with massively improving the
developer experience, including adding typings for queries via type generation.

Two major libraries we recommend using are:

-   [graphql-tag](https://www.npmjs.com/package/graphql-tag)

    A JavaScript template literal tag that parses GraphQL
    query strings into standard GraphQL AST.

-   [graphql-codegen](https://the-guild.dev/graphql/codegen)

    A GraphQL schema generation tool that allows you to get
    end-to-end type safety for all your GraphQL queries based on the GQL queries you write, and the schema you're
    querying against.

### Making a GraphQL query

In your `index.svelte` or more likely, your `+page.ts` or `+page.server.ts` file (please read up on
[routing in Svelte Kit](https://kit.svelte.dev/docs/routing#page-page-server-js)), you can make a GraphQL query using
the `gql` tag. The `graphql-tag` package converts the JavaScript template literal into a GraphQL
AST, which is then used by `graphql-codegen` to generate types for us.

Example usage:

```typescript
gql`
	query WidgetConfig {
		configuration_widget {
			config
			name
			type
			uuid
		}
	}
`;
```

We store our GraphQL client (urql) in a Svelte Store, which you can get, and use to make queries via urql's API.

Here is an example [Svelte page](https://kit.svelte.dev/docs/routing#page) with a Svelte Kit page load function that
makes a GraphQL query and passes the result as props to the page component:

In this example, the `WidgetConfigQuery` type and `WidgetConfigDocument` exports are generated using `graphql-codegen`,
which will be elaborated on in the [query types & codegen](#query-types--graphql-codegen) section.

```typescript title="+page.ts"
import { gqlClientStore } from "./graphql_client";
import { query } from "@mssfoobar/graphql/graphql";
import { type WidgetConfigQuery, WidgetConfigDocument } from "./index.generated";

gql`
	query WidgetConfig {
		configuration_widget {
			config
			name
			type
			uuid
		}
	}
`;

export async function load({}) {
	const client = $gqlClientStore;
	const response = await query<WidgetConfigQuery>(client, WidgetConfigDocument, {});

	return {
		configuration_widget: response.data?.configuration_widget,
	};
}
```

```html title="+page.svelte"
<script lang="ts">
	...
	// highlight-start
	// data.configuration_wdget has the data from your response
	const { data }: Props = $props();
	// highlight-end
	...
</script>
```

### Making a GraphQL Subscriptions

Urql performs GraphQL subscriptions using [Wonka](https://github.com/0no-co/wonka#wonka), a stream library. To handle
data received from Urql subscriptions, they must be piped into a `Wonka Subscribe` function and handled with a callback.

The following is a simple example of setting up a subscription using our framework. See the comments for more details.

```html title="+page.svelte"
<script lang="ts">
	import { SystemTimeDocument, type SystemTimeSubscription } from "$generated-types";

	import { get } from "svelte/store";
	import { type Subscription, pipe as wPipe, subscribe as wSubscribe } from "wonka";

	import { gqlClientStore } from "./graphql_client";
	import gql from "graphql-tag";
	import { onDestroy, onMount } from "svelte";

	let dateTime: ISO8601Date;
	let subscription: Subscription;

	onMount(async () => {
		// highlight-start
		// Get the GraphQL Client from the client store.
		// highlight-end
		const client = get(gqlClientStore);

		// highlight-start
		// Define the GraphQL subscription - this can be done in the same file, in a
		// separate `.graphql` file, or anywhere else - as long as it exists,
		// graphql-codegen will pick it up and generate the subscription type and
		// object for use. Remember to run GraphQL Codegen first!
		// highlight-end
		gql`
			subscription SystemTime {
				system_time {
					reported_at
				}
			}
		`;

		// highlight-start
		// Store the subscription so we can call unsubscribe later.
		// highlight-end
		subscription = wPipe(
			client.subscription<SystemTimeSubscription>(SystemTimeDocument, {}),
			wSubscribe((result) => {
				if (result?.data && result?.data?.system_time[0]) {
					dateTime = result.data.system_time[0].reported_at;
					logger.debug("Lets see the time!", dateTime);
				}
			})
		);
	});

	onDestroy(async () => {
		// highlight-start
		// Ensure you unsubscribe at the appropriate time. For example, when the component
		// unmounts. If you skip this step, your subscription will persist as you change
		// pages (with client-side navigation)
		// highlight-end
		if (subscription) subscription.unsubscribe();
	});
</script>
```

### Query Types & GraphQL Codegen

You should use `graphql-codegen` to generate the query shape/types from the the `schema.graphql` file. You can get the
schema file by using the introspection API from the GraphQL endpoint you are calling.

Use `graphqurl` to get the `schema.graphql` file and place it in the root directory. Learn how to use `graphqurl` to
pull the schema here: https://hasura.io/docs/latest/guides/export-graphql-schema/

Example:

<CodeBlock language="bash">
	{`gq `}
	<span class="highlight">GRAPHQURL ENDPOINT</span>
	{` --introspect > schema.graphql`}
</CodeBlock>

Replace <span class="highlight">GRAPHQURL ENDPOINT</span> with your actual GraphQL URL.

Run GraphQL Codegen with the appropriate configuration (`codegen.yml` in this example) to generate the types, you should
configure it to appear in a folder called `generated` (or something similar) and git ignore the folder.

```bash
graphql-codegen --config codegen.yml
```

After generating these types, you can now have full typescript definitions for your GraphQL queries. Remember to run
`gq` (graphqurl) again whenever your GraphQL schema changes, and to run `graphql-codegen` whenever you write new
queries, or need to update the queries with the new schema.

## Broken Queries, Subscriptions, and Retries

There are 2 layers of retries that have been set up:

-   The `urql` client has been set up to handle retries via the `retryExchange`.
-   The `graphql-ws` client has been set up to handle broken WebSocket connections with retries
-   They are both configured to exponentially backoff retries on failure.

The `urql` client is set up to retry only subscriptions, as it is assumed that when you make a subscription, you want
this connection to be open and receiving data indefinitely. Queries are not retried automatically.

Subscriptions use the `graphql-ws` transport, this creates and manages a websocket connection, which `urql` then uses.
The JWT is passed to the GraphQL serever when the subscription is first created and the websocket connection gets
opened. Your GraphQl server will likely use the expiry time in the token to decide when to terminate the GraphQL
connection. This closing of the connection will cause all subscriptions to fail - they will all then be automatically
retried with the new access token.

In some cases, you might have passed a variable into your subscription that might need to be updated when a retry
occurs. This is particularly necessary when you use something like Hasura's streaming subscriptions, which requires a
cursor to determine where to start pulling data from. Your subscription would be retried with the original cursor value,
causing your application to retrieve duplicate data. To deal with this, you must pass a context object with the
properties `onConnectionClosed` and `onConnectionConnected` to your GraphQL subscriptions. These must contain a callback
function that takes in an operation as an argument and returns nothing. An event listener will call these functions when
the GraphQL WebSocket connection closes and connects respectively, allowing you to reset subscriptions as needed.

Example:

```tsx title="Streaming Subscriptions with Timestamp Cursor Example"
onMount(async () => {
	const client = get(gqlClientStore);

	gql`
		subscription ExampleStreaming($createdAt: timestampz) {
			some_data_stream {
				id
			}
		}
	`;

	let streamingSubscription: Subscription;

	function createExampleStreamingSubscription() {
		return wPipe(
			client.subscription<ExampleStreamingSubscription>(
				ExampleStreamingDocument,
				{
					created_at: dayjs($systemTime).toISOString() ?? dayjs().toISOString(),
				},
				{
					// highlight-start
					// Pass in the callback function to update the operation variables on connection loss.
					onConnectionClosed: (operation: Operation) => {
						operation.variables = {
							created_at: dayjs($systemTime).toISOString() ?? dayjs().toISOString(),
						};

						// cleanup
						streamingSubscription.unsubscribe();
					},
					onConnectionConnected: (operation: Operation) => {
						// Only create subscriptions if they don't exist (or will be double-added in this callback)
						if (!streamingSubscription) {
							streamingSubscription = createExampleStreamingSubscription();
						}
					},
					// highlight-end
				}
			),
			wSubscribe((result) => {
				if (result?.data && result?.data?.some_data_stream[0]) {
					logger.debug({ id: result.data.some_data_stream[0].id }, "How? Is this what you want?");
				}
			})
		);
	}

	streamingSubscription = createExampleStreamingSubscription();
});
```
