# UNH Lib Folder
The `lib/aoh/unh` folder contains reusable components and utility functions that are shared across the project. This document outlines the structure, usage guidelines, and best practices for working within the folder.

## Structure
The `lib/aoh/unh` folder is organized as follows:

```
├── src/
│    └── lib/
│    │     └── aoh/
│    │          ├── core/
│    │ ...      └── unh/
│    │               ├── api/
│    │               ├── components/
│    │               │     ├── custom/
│    │               │     ├── pages/
│    │               │     └── ui/
│    │               ├── helpers/
│    │               ├── interfaces/
│    │               ├── test/
│    │               ├── constant.ts
│    │               ├── storybook.d.ts
│    │               └── utils.ts
```

## Api Folder
The `api/ `folder provides server-side handling for data-related operations within the application. Instead of making direct API calls on the client side, this module leverages [Svelte's form actions](https://svelte.dev/docs/kit/form-actions) to efficiently process form submissions and data interactions.

All named actions used for handling forms and tables are placed in this folder to ensure a clear separation of concerns and improve maintainability.

## Components Folder
The `components/` folder contains reusable UI elements that help build the frontend application efficiently. It is further divided into subfolders for better organization:

- `custom/`: Custom components specific to the project's unique requirements.

- `pages/`: Instead of placing the page logic directly inside `+page.svelte` files, each page is turned into a separate component and stored in this folder. This approach makes it easier to import, reuse, and test.

- `ui/`: Contains ShadCN-Svelte components that are used in this module.

## Helpers Folder
Contains functions that rovide support or aid to other parts of the module.

## Interfaces Folder
Contains the interface definitions and their corresponding schemas.

## Test Folder
Contains test files for helper functions.
