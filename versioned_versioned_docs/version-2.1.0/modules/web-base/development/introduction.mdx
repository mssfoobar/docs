# Introduction

The purpose section is not to be a tutorial on [Svelte](https://svelte.dev/tutorial/svelte/welcome-to-svelte) and
[Svelte Kit](https://kit.svelte.dev/docs/introduction), you should visit their official documentation to learn more
about them.

Also, the development documentation here is oriented at projects utilizing the `Web Base` to develop applications that
need not adhere to the AGIL Ops Hub module development format (which allows installation and publishing of web modlets),
for information on contributing new modlets, visit the respective docs
[here](/docs/stable/contributing/development/module-development).

Instead, it will only include information that is specific to AGIL Ops Hub. Here are some useful links you might be
looking for:

## [How To Create A Page](https://svelte.dev/tutorial/kit/pages)

Follow the link above to Svelte Kit's official documentation on creating pages.

## [How To Create A Component](https://svelte.dev/tutorial/svelte/your-first-component)

Follow the link above to Svelte's official documentatin on creating Svelte components.

## [How To Add Styles](https://tailwindcss.com/docs/styling-with-utility-classes)

Follow the link above to Tailwind CSS's official documentation on styling with utility classes.

We recommend that you **DO NOT** style your components using the `<style>` tags - this defeats the purposes of using
Tailwind. You should [read more about Tailwind CSS' core
concepts](https://tailwindcss.com/docs/styling-with-utility-classes#why-not-just-use-inline-styles) to understand why
we want to keep to using utility classes. Tailwid CSS also adds a lot of very powerful tooling that makes styling
easy. Only break out when **absolutely necessary**, that's usually only the case when certain third-party libraries
impose restrictions that require you to use CSS directly.

## [How To Manage State](https://svelte.dev/tutorial/svelte/stores)

Follow the link above to Svelte Kit's official documentation on advanced reactivity. With Svelte 5, you likely can use
the `$state` instead for many cases.

## [How To Write Unit Tests](https://vitest.dev/guide/#writing-tests)

Follow the link above to Vitest's official documentation on writing tests.

## [How To Write Component Tests](https://storybook.js.org/docs/get-started/frameworks/sveltekit#writing-native-svelte-stories)

Follow the link above to Storybook's official documentation on writing stories for Svelte Kit.

Storybook is a framework to generate "stories" that can serve to both document and test stories or features that your
system needs to provide. We recommend you use Storybook to do component-level tests.

:::note
The `Web Base` already has Storybook installed but you will probably want to perform additional configuration for your
project's purposes (if you do decide to use Storybook).

We have plans to provide full-fleged guidelines and tutorials that we recommend **all** projects follow. Stay tuned.
