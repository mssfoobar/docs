# Configuration

All the UCS modules configurations can be configured either using toml files or environment variables.
For example, if the module toml file has below configuration:

```toml
[sql]
host = "localhost"
port = "5432"
user = "postgres"
password = "postgres"
```

And if you rather want to use environment variable for sensitive information, you can override it like below:

```toml
[sql]
host = "localhost"
port = "5432"
user = "" # empty or remove
password = "" # empty or remove
```

In deployment file, toml variable `[sql]user` & `[sql]password` becomes `SQL_USER` & `SQL_PASSWORD` respectively.

```yaml
service:
    ucs-room-mgmt:
        environment:
            - SQL_USER=postgres
            - SQL_PASSWORD=postgres
```

If values are present in both toml file and environment variable, the value from environment variable will be used.

## Using compose.override.yml to customize container settings

The `compose.override.yml` file is used to override the default settings in the `./ucs/compose.yml` file

Below is an example of `compose.overwrite.yml` that map the Database port 5432 to Host port 5432.

```yaml
name: aoh
services:
  ucs-db:
    ports:
      - 5432:5432
```

To run the docker compose file with the override file, run the following command:

```bash
docker compose --env-file .env -f ucs/compose.yml -f compose.override.yml --profile docker up -d
```
