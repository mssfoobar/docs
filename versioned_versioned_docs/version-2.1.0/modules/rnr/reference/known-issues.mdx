# Known Issues

## Shared Session Limitation

The system uses a single shared session on the server, meaning all connected clients interact with the same session state. As a result:
- Changes made by one client (e.g., playback controls, speed adjustments) will affect all other connected clients.
- Clients may receive unexpected session updates if another user modifies the session state.
- There is no isolation per userâ€”everyone sees the same session progress and status.

## `display_status` Freezing Issue

In some cases, the `display_status` may become stuck at a `IN_PROGRESS` state because the session status freezes on the server. When this happens, the session stops progressing, and no further updates are sent to the clients.
