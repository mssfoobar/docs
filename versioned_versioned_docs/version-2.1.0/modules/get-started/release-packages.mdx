# Release Packages

AGIL Ops Hub releases consists of the following:

-   [Container Images](#container-images) and corresponding [Docker Compose](#docker-compose-files) configuration files
-   [Node Packages](#node-packages)
-   [Source Code Packages](#source-code-packages)

These release artifacts are made available privately via [GitHub Packages](https://docs.github.com/en/packages), and
[GitHub Source Code Repositories](https://github.com/github). Please approach one of our friendly AGIL Ops Hub team
members to for access.

Although possible, it is `not` recommended to have all your project team members directly access the
[AGIL Ops Hub Private Package Registry](https://github.com/orgs/mssfoobar/packages),
and [Source Repository](https://github.com/mssfoobar/) for those artifacts for both development and production.

Instead, your project should designate a representative (i.e. `Configuration Manager`) to review and move only the
required artifacts into your project's own `SCM`
([software configuration management](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Software_configuration_management)) ecosystem
(probably consisting of an **artifact registry** and source code **version control system**).

The rest of the project members should only access your project's own artifact registry and source repository for the
required artifacts.

This allows for better dependency management within your project. Furthermore, your project's `Docker Compose`
configuration files and web application source code will need to be updated based on your project's own needs. These
modified files should be version controlled in your own source/version control system.

## Container Images

All AGIL Ops Hub modules, except `Web Base`, will have container images for the **backend** services. Some may also have
container images for a **frontend** web application.

:::caution
Container images provided are `Linux` containers for the `x86-64 architecture`.

Please approach the AGIL Ops Hub team if you require containers to be built for other operating systems or instruction
set architectures (such as `Windows` or `ARM`).
:::

The container image for **backend** services are intended to be used **as is**, for both `development` and `production`.

As for the **frontend** web app containers, they contain the pre-built `Web Base` bundled with the respective
`Web Components` from the module; these frontend containers are typically ready-to-use consoles,
which serve as platforms for us to validate and test our modules. These containers are `not` intended for production
use.

Typically, projects would install a few modules' web components into single one `Web Base`, modify the Web UIs to follow
their own specific UI/UX and design, and then build them into their own container image for production use.

:::note
More details on the `Web Base` will be covered later in its [own section](../web-base/overview/overview.md).
:::

As mentioned, projects should review and transfer the container images of the desired modules to their own
`Container Registry`.

In general, the steps to transfer the container images into a `Container Registry` will involve:

-   Pulling the container images using `Docker` or `Podman`
-   Re-tagging the images
-   Push the images into the project's `Container Registry`

For projects with **air-gap** requirements, the steps should be as follows:

-   Pull the container images using `Docker` or `Podman` in a secure, Internet-connected machine
-   Export the container images into tar archives using the `save` command in `Docker` or `Podman`
-   Move the tar archives into the **air-gapped** environment
-   `Load` the container images back into `Docker` or `Podman` from the tar files
-   Re-tag the images
-   Push the images into the project's `Container Registry`

## Docker Compose Files

AGIL Ops Hub also releases a set of corresponding `Docker Compose` configuration files to run our containers in `Docker`
or `Podman` engine. This allows developers to quickly and easily set up a local development environment.

:::danger
The `Docker Compose` configuration files are intended to be used to deploy containers in `Docker` or `Podman` engine for
`development` purposes only!

It is **not** recommended to deploy containers in `Docker` or `Podman` engine for **production**, except for small scale projects that only have a handful
of containers and with no high-availability (**HA**) requirement.

For most projects, it is recommended that you use `Kubernetes` or some other suitable container orchestration platform
(e.g. `Docker Swarm` or `Amazon Elastic Container Service`).

As production deployment environments vary wildly across projects, it is not possible to provide a standard set of
deployment manifest files. AGIL Ops Hub team will instead work with the project to craft the manifest files for the
specific target environment.
:::

The `Docker Compose` configuration files are published in the
[`dev-containers` repository](https://github.com/mssfoobar/dev-containers).

The steps to move those files to your project's own `SCM` would typically be:

-   Download the `dev-containers` repository as zip
-   Unzip to your local machine
-   Review and modify the files based on your project's and environment's needs
-   Add the modified files to the project's source code repository for version control and distribution amonst project
    members

## Node Packages

AGIL Ops Hub also releases node packages for:

-   Module Web Components

    These are special node packages that can **must** installed into `Web Base` using `Web CLI tool`. This
    allows the project to only add (install) each module's web components that are needed by the project.

-   Web CLI Tool

    The `Web CLI Tool` that is used to install `Module Web Components` is itself a `node package` which will be installed
    when the `Web Base` is initialized.

-   Web Libraries

    These are reusable libraries to simplify web development. Currently, it contains:

    -   `Logger` - logging library for both Web frontend (at browser console) and Web backend (at container) logging.
    -   `SSE Client` - to simplify writing server-send events (SSE) code on the frontend.
    -   `GraphQL Client`- facilitate access GraphQL APIs from frontend.

Generally, the steps to move the node packages to your project's **artifact registry** is as follows:

-   Install the package at the specified version using the `npm install` command.
-   Set npm to point to the project's registry using the `npm config set` command.
-   Publish the package to project registry using the `npm publish` command.

## Source Code Packages

AGIL Ops Hub publishes source code packages for:

-   Web Base

    `Web Base` is a scaffold `SvelteKit` project that provides a skeleton application to kick-start web development
    using AGIL Ops Hub. For more information, refer to the [`Web Base` section](../web-base/overview/overview.md).

-   Workflow Activity Template

    The Workflow Activity Template is a scaffold `golang` project that provides template project code to kick-start
    workflow activity development using `golang`. For more information, refer to the
    [Workflow Activity Development Section](../wfe/development/activity-developer-guide/overview).

-   Workflow Studio

    Workflow Studio is the web application that allows users to design and configure workflows. Projects can directly
    use the pre-built Workflow Studio container for deployment. If customize of the Workflow Studio is required, the
    source code is also available.

These source code packages can be access from the respective repositories on GitHub. Projects should download the source
code as zip files and upload them into their respective `SCM` as necessary.
