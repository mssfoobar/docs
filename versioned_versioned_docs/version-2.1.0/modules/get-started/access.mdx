# Access Configuration

As mentioned in previous section, release artifacts are available privately via
[GitHub Packages](https://docs.github.com/en/packages), and through
[GitHub Source Code Repositories](https://github.com/github).

If you are the project member that has been designated to move the release artifacts to your own artifact registry
and source code repository, you will need to have a `GitHub account` and have been granted access to AGIL Ops Hub's
private [packages](https://github.com/orgs/mssfoobar/packages) and [code repositories](https://github.com/mssfoobar/).

:::note
You may refer to
[these instructions](https://docs.github.com/en/get-started/start-your-journey/creating-an-account-on-github) for
detailed steps on creating an account on GitHub.
:::

Once, you have a `GitHub account`, approach any AGIL Ops Hub member with your account details (`email address` /
`username`) to be granted access. You will then be able to download source code directly from
https://github.com/mssfoobar via your browser.

import downloadAsZipImg from "@site/static//img/modules/get-started/access/download-as-zip.png";

<div class="centerize">
	<div style={{ marginBottom: "2rem", maxWidth: "700px" }}>
		<Image img={downloadAsZipImg} />
	</div>
</div>

For `Container Images` and `Node Packages`, you will need to configure your `Docker` and `npm` as follows to access.

## Setting Up

### Create your personal access token

For GitHub, you will need to generate a personal access token with `read:packages` scope to download container images.
You can refer to GitHub's official instructions on how to generate personal access tokens here:
[Creating a GitHub Personal Access Token](https://docs.github.com/en/authentication/keeping-your-account-and-data-secure/managing-your-personal-access-tokens#creating-a-personal-access-token-classic)

If you're using different software configuration management tools, please consult your `configuration manager` on how
to gain access to the relevant packages.

### Configuring `Docker` to have access to pull Container Images

1. To check if you have access to the container registry, you can log in to your `GitHub account` and then browse for
   the required images here: https://github.com/orgs/mssfoobar/packages. If you are unable to see the container image
   you need, your account may not have the required access. Please approach an AGIL Ops Hub team member for assistance.

2. Login to Docker with the token:

<CodeBlock language="bash">
	{`$ echo `}
	<span className="highlight">TOKEN</span>
	{` | docker login ghcr.io -u `}
	<span className="highlight">USERNAME</span>
	{` --password-stdin`}
</CodeBlock>

-   Replace <span className="highlight">TOKEN</span> with your token generated in step 2
-   Replace <span className="highlight">USERNAME</span> with your GitHub username

For more details on working with GitHub's container registry, you can refer to their
[official documentation](https://docs.github.com/en/packages/working-with-a-github-packages-registry/working-with-the-container-registry).

### Configuring `npm` to have access to pull packages

The simplest way to pull released node packages is to use the `Web Base` and `Web CLI Tools` to pull the packages required.
By default, `Web Base` will include an `.npmrc` file which points to `npm.pkg.github.com` for npm packages with
the `@mssfoobar` scope.

Run the following command to configure `npm` to have access to pull the packages.

<CodeBlock language="bash">
	{`$ npm set //npm.pkg.github.com/:_authToken=`}
	<span className="highlight">GITHUB_PERSONAL_ACCESS_TOKEN</span>
</CodeBlock>

-   Replace <span className="highlight">GITHUB_PERSONAL_ACCESS_TOKEN</span>

## Making Authenticated Service API Calls

When making calls to our backend services, all protected routes will require an access token. We use the [Bearer
Authentication Scheme](https://www.rfc-editor.org/rfc/rfc6750) - you are expected to pass an `Authorization` header,
with the value "Bearer <span class="highlight">ACCESS TOKEN</span>".

```typescript title="+server.ts"
import type { ServerLoad } from "@sveltejs/kit";
import { env } from "$env/dynamic/private";
import { StatusCodes } from "http-status-codes";

export const load: ServerLoad = async ({ locals }) => {
	if (!locals.authResult.success) {
		return new Response(
			JSON.stringify({
				message: "Unauthorized",
			}),
			{
				status: StatusCodes.UNAUTHORIZED,
			}
		);
	}

	// highlight-start
	const bearerAuthorizationString = `Bearer ${locals.authResult.access_token}`;

	const headers = {
		"Content-Type": "application/json",
		Authorization: bearerAuthorizationString,
	};

	const interesting_data = await fetch(env.INTERESTING_URL + "/juicy_data", {
		method: "GET",
		headers,
	});
	// highlight-end

	const result = await interesting_data.json();

	return {
		my_interesting_data: result,
	};
};
```

In the TypeScript example above, the access token is retrieved from via framework mechanisms
(`locals.authResult.access_token`), for more information, see the
[Access Control](../web-base/development/access-control.mdx) section of the `Web Framework`.

Below is a curl example of making a request with an authorization bearer token.

<CodeBlock language="bash">
	{`curl -H "Authorization: Bearer `}
	<span className="highlight">ACCESS TOKEN</span>
	{`" http://www.example.com `}
</CodeBlock>

## Troubleshooting

### `Repository not found`

```bash title="Terminal output attempting to clone private repository"
git clone https://github.com/mssfoobar/web-base
Cloning into 'web-base'...
remote: Repository not found.
fatal: repository 'https://github.com/mssfoobar/web-base/' not found
```

If you don't have access to the repository and you attempt to clone it, you'll run into a `Repository not found` error.

This sample output is with trying to access our code directly from our GitHub repository without permissions. Your
`configuration manager` should be instructing you on how to configure your system to pull from your own code repository
(which could be GitHub, GitLab, Gitea, or some other solution entirely).

If you're trying to pull from our GitHub repositories directly - follow the instructions
[here](https://docs.github.com/en/get-started/getting-started-with-git/set-up-git) to ensure that your terminal has
`git` configured to have access to your GitHub account. If you still don't have access, it's possible your account has
not been granted read permissions (you should be able to see the repository online).

### `npm error code E404`

```bash title="Partial terminal output after running npm install"
npm error code E404
npm error 404 Not Found - GET https://registry.npmjs.org/@mssfoobar%2fcli - Not found
npm error 404
npm error 404 '@mssfoobar/cli@^1.0.3' is not in this registry.

```

This error stems from your npm configuration not being set to pull these private packages from the appropriate registry.

By default, there's a `.npmrc` file in the root folder of the `Web Base` that points `@mssfoobar` scoped packages to
our npm registry (https://npm.pkg.github.com). This configuration might have been overriden such it is now trying to
pull from `https://registry.npmjs.org` instead (the default npm registry).

Regardless, in your project, your configuration manager should have set up **YOUR OWN PRIVATE** registry to install
packages - check with your `configuration manager` what this should be.

### `npm error code E401`

```bash title="Partial terminal output after running npm install"
npm error code E401
npm error 401 Unauthorized - GET https://npm.pkg.github.com/@mssfoobar%2fcli - authentication token not provided
```

Whenever you try to access a private package with npm that you're not allowed to, you'll get a `401 Unauthorized` error
\- in the case of `@mssfoobar`-scoped packages, you might have configured npm to connect to the correct registry, but
you have not [configured the `_auth` setting in npm](https://docs.npmjs.com/cli/v11/using-npm/config#_auth).

When connecting to our packages in GitHub, the steps to remediate this is listed above:
[Configuring `npm` to have access to pull packages](#configuring-npm-to-have-access-to-pull-packages). However, if you
are using your own project registry, you will have to check with your `configuration manager` what this should be.
