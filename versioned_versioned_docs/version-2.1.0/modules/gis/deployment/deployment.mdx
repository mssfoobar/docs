# Deployment

import deploymentDiagram from "@site/static/img/modules/gis/gis-deployment.png";
import Image from "@theme/IdealImage";

The `GIS` comprises of the modlet, backend server, and database. The following diagram shows the GIS and its
dependencies. Note that in its current incarnation, the `GIS` is not involved in supplying map tiles. Its purview
is strictly for operational entities, and uses the `RTUS` to update these entities to the frontend live.

## Deployment Artifacts

### GIS:

-   Service Container:

    `ghcr.io/mssfoobar/gis/gis-app:v2.0.0`

-   Modlet:

    `@mssfoobar/gis-web@v1.1.0` - this is deployed as part of your application's web server

-   Database:

    The `GIS` requires its own schema in a Postgres database, we recommend using the shortname of the module for the
    name of the schema (`gis`).

You can find the available configuration parameters at the
[`configuration section`](../configuration/configuration.mdx) and real examples at the `GIS` compose
section of the [`dev-containers`](https://github.com/mssfoobar/dev-containers/blob/develop/gis/compose.yml) repository.

### Others (Dependencies):

The GIS requires the following services to be deployed to function properly. The client must also be able to connect
to the `RTUS` for the live events to be sent.

-   `IAMS`
-   `RTUS`
