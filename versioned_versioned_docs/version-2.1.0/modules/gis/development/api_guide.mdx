# API Guide

The `GIS` service API's are available via the Open API specification. This guide serves as examples of how you can
use the some of API's to achieve certain outcomes.

:::caution
This guide is **NOT** a full list of the available API's, for the complete list, please refer to the Open API
specification [here](https://github.com/mssfoobar/gis/releases/tag/gis-service%2Fv1.0.0).
:::

As shown in the [operating concept section](../overview.mdx#operating-concept), you will be populating
the `GIS` application with geoentities that you want to appear on the map. This will come from your own services.

To do this, you must call the `GIS` service API's. We provide API's for you to add, update, and delete entities. This
guide will give you some examples on how you can use the API to map your system's entities to geoentities to be shown
on the `GIS`.

:::info
When calling any of the endpoints in this guide, remember that to make protected API requests, you will need to pass a
valid access token with the request, see
[here](../../get-started/access.mdx#making-authenticated-service-api-calls) for more information.
:::

## Fetching the GIS state

The map components in the `modlet` already does this by receiving server-sent-events from the `RTUS - SEH` service. So
for the frontend, you should not need to do this unless you want to represent the data differently in your own custom
UI.

The backend, however, might need to fetch state to synchronize the geoentities with the business entities.

You can pull any of the `GIS` entities (currently Bookmark and Geoentity) using the `GET` endpoints:

### Bookmark

```text title="Get Bookmark"
GET /bookmark/id/:bookmark_id
```

```text title="Get Bookmark by Id"
GET /bookmark/id/:bookmark_id
```

### Geoentity

```text title="Get Geoentity"
GET /geoentity
```

```text title="Get Geoentity by Kind"
GET /geoentity/kind/:kind
```

```text title="Get Geoentity by Entity Id"
GET /geoentity/entity_id/:entity_id
```

```text title="Get Geoentity by Id"
GET /geoentity/id/:entity_id
```

Consult the [Open API specification](https://github.com/mssfoobar/gis/releases/tag/gis-service%2Fv1.0.0) for more
details.

## Adding Geoentities to the Map

Your system receives airplane telemetry data through your enterprise service bus. You aggregate all this information,
and correlate it with other services into your own model of aircraft information, some few key details such as:

-   Aircraft Registration Number
-   Aircraft Telemetry
-   Latitude
-   Longitude
-   Altitude
-   Heading
-   Callsign

You wish to have each airplane rendered on the map based on its longitude and latitude, with the flight information as
a label.

To achieve this, you will need to constantly update your flight's state in the `GIS`. For such live tracking use-cases,
enterprises are usually interested in monitoring a fleet of vehicles with telemetry, so for performance reasons, we
provide a "batch" endpoint to allow updating multiple entities at one go.

### `Upsert Geoentity Batch`

You can use the batch geoentity upsert endpoint to create or update multiple geoentities at once. Call the `PUT` API
`/geoentity/batch` with your entity data. The service allows you to specify an `entity_id` to uniquely identify
geoentities.

The endpoint expects an array of geoentities.

             {
                 "entity_id": "SIA001",
                 "geojson": {

                         "type": "Point",

                         "callsign": "SIA001",
                         "heading": 240

                         "type": "Point",
                         "coordinates": [103.94823, 1.27097]
                     },

         ]'
     `}
</CodeBlock>

#### Response

```text title="Status Code"
201 Created
```

</details>

:::caution
Note the distinction between `id` and `entity_id`. `id` is generated by the `GIS` service, whilst `entity_id` is an
extra user-defined identifier that you must pass.
:::

### Other Endpoints

Apart from the `Upsert` (PUT) example, which is most commonly what would you use in the live update scenario, you can
use the `Create` and `Update` (POST and PATCH) endpoints to add and modify entities.

Consult the [Open API specification](https://github.com/mssfoobar/gis/releases/tag/gis-service%2Fv1.0.0) for more
details.

```text title="Create Geoentity"
POST /geoentity
```

```text title="Create Geoentity Batch"
POST /geoentity/batch
```

```text title="Update Geoentity by Id"
PATCH /geoentity/id/:id
```

```text title="Update Geoentity by Entity Id"
PATCH /geoentity/entity_id/:entity_id
```

```text title="Upsert Geoentity"
PUT /geoentity/entity_id/:entity_id
```

```text title="Upsert Geoentity by Id"
PUT /geoentity/id/:id
```

## Removing Geoentities

When your entity should no longer be displayed on the map, you will need to remove it. Most likely, your backend
services will be doing this at regular intervals, and as a batch call to improve performance.

### `Delete Geoentity by Entity Id Batch`

We provide a `Delete Geoentity by Entity Id Batch` endpoint for you to delete many entities at once based on an array of
string ID's:

<details>
 <summary>Example</summary>

#### Request

<CodeBlock title="DELETE /geoentity/entity_id/batch">
	{`curl -L '`}
	<span class="highlight">BASE URL</span>
	{`/geoentity/entity_id/batch'
         --header 'Content-Type: application/json'
         --header 'Authorization: `}
	<span class="highlight">TOKEN</span>
	{`
         --data-raw '[
             "SIA001",
             "SIA002"
         ]'
    `}
</CodeBlock>

#### Response

```text title="Status Code"
204 No Content
```

:::caution
If you pass one or more `entity_id`'s into the array that does not exist, you will not be given an error response. The
API simply attempts to delete all entities with the provided entity id's.
:::

### Other Endpoints

```text title="Delete Geoentity by Id"
DELETE /geoentity/id/:geoentity_id
```

```text title="Delete Geoentity by Id Batch"
DELETE /geoentity/id/batch
```

```text title="Delete Geoentity by Entity Id"
DELETE /geoentity/entity_id/:entity_id
```

```text title="Delete Geoentity by Entity Id Batch"
DELETE /geoentity/entity_id/batch
```
