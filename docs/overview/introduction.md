# Introduction 🆕

## Introduction

AgilRAD 2.0 or `AR2` is a platform for developing, testing, and deploying C2 (Command & Control) systems. Out of the
box, we aim to support many different use-cases but mainly with C2 systems in-mind.

**Planned Features**

-   Charting [✔️]
-   Configurable dashboards [✔️]
-   Text, Audio, and Video chat [✔️]
-   Real-time Mapping
-   Recording & Playback
-   Incident Management
-   Complex Event Processing
-   Simulation

## Philosophy

For the system to be successful, we require buy-in from all stakeholders, including and especially developers. The stack
we have is extremely modern, aimed to please as many parties as possible. Clients' demands based on current technology
trends; which emphasizes secure, scalable, flexible systems, are met with the micro-service architecture. To help with
developers' needs, we focus on provided strong documentation, powerful modern tooling, and automation wherever it makes
sense.

## Technologies

To support the infrastructure to allow our systems to be distributed, scalable, durable, performant,
maintainable, and to allow automated testing, security scanning and alerting, and deployment, many different pieces
need to fit together to support the backbone of the system.

The following is the evolving list of technologies chosen to support development of the **AR2** platform.

# Platform Infrastructure

### Container Management

-   [Kubernetes](https://kubernetes.io/)

    In order to support a micro-services architecture, we need to be able to orchestrate the automatic scaling or services.
    Our services need to be containerized and monitored, stood up or down depending on their needs, and have their traffic
    routed accordingly. The de-facto standard across the industry for container orchestration is Kubernetes, which is what
    we've adopted.
