# Development

The development section that you write for your module should provide step by step instructions with examples of
how to use your API. In this `Documentation` case, we'll actually be providing you with step-by-step- instructions on
how to create the API documentation in the `Example API` section.

## Docusaurus Open API Docs Plugin

The documentation in the API section is generated from an Open API file using a Docusarus plugin. This document will not
cover how to write an Open API specification file, but will provide some guidance on how it maps to documentation in
Docusaurus.

## Pre-requisites

-   The Open API file for your service. The example for this section can be found at `openapi/documentation/mnm-v1.yaml`.

## Docusaurus configuration

In order for the doc generation to work, you will need to copy in your Open API file.

### 1. Create a new folder in the `openapi` folder

The folder name should match your module name:

```bash title="aoh-docs >"
mkdir openapi/my_new_module
```

### 2. Copy your Open API file into the folder.

This should be a `.yaml` file. The following block shows which important fields in the Open API spec map to
Docusaurus docs:

```yaml title="mnm-v1.yaml"
info:
    description: |
        This maps to the "Introduction" page.
    paths:
        examplePath:
            summary: This will appear as the page title of each endpoint
            description: |
                This will appear as the description of your endpoint
```

You should not need to adjust your Open API file much to fit this but it is important to note that the `summary` is
akin to a title for the endpoint.

Next, you will need to modify the Docusaurus config files to consider your new Open API file for doc generation.

### 3. Create a new entry in the `docusaurus-plugin-openapi-docs` config

The entry should use the following format:

-   `my_new_module`: The name of your module. This will influence the Open API generation command, change the property
    key to fit your module name.
-   `specPath`: The path to your Open API specification file.
-   `outpurDir`: The directory to place the generated files - this should be where your new module documentation resides.

The 3 properties above should be changed, leave the rest of the options as they are.

```js title="aoh-docs/docusaurus.config.js"
const config = {
    ...
    plugins: [
        ...
        [
            ...
            {
                ...
                config: {
                    // highlight-start
                    my_new_module: {
                        specPath: "openapi/my_new_module/mnm-v1.yaml",
                        outputDir: "docs/91_documentation/Example API",
                    // highlight-end
                        sidebarOptions: {
                            groupPathsBy: "tag",
                        },
                        hideSendButton: true,
                    },
                }
                ...
            }
        ]
        ...
    ]
    ...
}

```

### 4. Restart the Docusaurus server

If the server is already running locally, you will need to restart it first:

Hit `Ctrl + C` to stop the currently running server. Then run:

```bash title="aoh-docs >"
npm run start
```

### 5. Check for errors

Successfully serving Docusaurus in development mode via `start` does not guarantee that it will successfully build. The
build process performs additional checks, most notably, it exhaustively looks for broken links in the project.

Before committing your changes, make sure to run `build` and `serve` to see if there are any issues in the production
build after making your changes.

````bash title="aoh-docs >"
npm run build

```bash title="aoh-docs >"
npm run serve
````
