# Modlet Development

`Modlets` are what we call the web portions of each module. They comprise of all the web (Svelte) components, web
libraries, routes and API endpoints that make up the web portions of a module. These components are packaged into
npm node modules in a format that allows them to be easily installed using our CLI.

When developing your custom modlet on top of the `Web Base`, it's essential to follow a few standards to for it to be
easily packaged for distribution.

## CLI Tool Packaging Requirements

Our `Web Base` features a built-in packaging feature that streamlines the process of extracting and publishing your
modlets to our registry.

### Required Folders

To ensure seamless integration with the `Web Base`, you must compartmentalize the files that need to be exported,
making it easy for others to use your modlet.

-   **Components / modlet folder**:

    Store all your reusable components and modlets, such as Svelte components, in a
    single folder.

    -   `src/lib/<project-name>/<module-name>` - we refer to this as the modlet's lib folder

-   **Routes (public and private) folders**:

    SvelteKit does not support package routes, to circumvent this we also use a standardized structure to allow us to
    have the CLI tool copy routes to their appropriate locations. Organize your routes into two separate folders - one
    set under `(public)` for routes that do not require access control, and the other set under `(private)` for routes
    that do require access control.

    -   `src/routes/(public)/<project-name>/<module-name>`
    -   `src/routes/(private)/<project-name>/<module-name>`

By adhering to our recommended folder structure, you'll enable the packaging manager to easily identify and extract the
necessary files for packaging as well as publish your modlets to our registry without errors or complications.

### Example Folder Structure

The following example is for a project named `foo` and a modlet/module named `bar`.

```bash title="Folder Structure"
...
src
├─lib
│   └─foo
│     └─bar
│       └─ <whatever files you put under here is up to you>
├─routes
│ ├─(private)
│ │  └─foo
│ │    └─bar
│ │      └── <whatever files you put under here is up to you>
│ └─(public)
│   └─foo
│     └─bar
│       └── <whatever files you put under here is up to you>
package.json
...
```

The structure of the contents within these folders are entirely up to you. You are free to organize your files and
create more folders as you see fit as long as they are contained within these 3. They are namespaced by **project** and
**module** names (`foo` and `bar` respectively) to avoid name clashes.

We recommend keeping Svelte components to a folder called "components".
