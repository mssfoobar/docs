# Overview

This section outlines the standard operating procedure for creating a new software release using the GitFlow workflow. 
This version **incorporates GitHub Pull Requests (PRs)** for merging the release into `main` and back into `develop`, leveraging GitHub's review, CI checks, 
and controlled merge capabilities.

Following these steps ensures consistency, allows for final review, and properly integrates release changes back into the main development line.

The following figure depicts the GitFlow:

## Prerequisites

Before starting the release process, ensure the following:

* You have Git installed and configured locally.
* You have appropriate permissions in the GitHub repository (`origin`) to create branches, push branches, create pull requests, and potentially merge pull requests 
(any team members other than the PR creator will have the merge permissions).
* Our standard branches `main` (for production releases) and `develop` (for ongoing integration) exist and are reasonably up-to-date locally.
* The `develop` branch contains all features and commits intended for this specific release.
* The **version number** (VERSION) for the new release has been decided (e.g., `v1.2.0`). We are using Semantic Versioning (`vX.Y.Z`) for individual services and/or packages and libraries.
* The **release branch name** (BRANCH_NAME) has been decided. The **release branch name** will this format **YYYYMMDD/rc** where `YYYYMMDD` is the current date that the release branch is to be created.
(e.g., 20250415/rc) 
* The **name** (COMPONENT_NAME) of the component(s) to be release has been decided (e.g., `gis-web`).  

:::note Components Release
The steps highlighted can be used to release single or multiple components within same modules (same repository). 

If multiple components are to be release, the step 7 will need to be repeated for each component.

Each component can have different version number.

:::

:::note Component Release Tag
The release tag to be used in step 8 should use this format **COMPONENT_NAME/VERSION** (e.g., gis-web/v1.2.0)
:::

## Release Steps

:::caution Important
Remember to replace the `BRANCH_NAME` (e.g., `20250415/rc`), `VERSION` (e.g., `v1.2.0`), and `COMPONENT_NAME` (e.g., `gis-web`) placeholders in the commands and 
descriptions below with your actual target release branch name, version number, and component name.

:::

### Step 1: Ensure `develop` is Ready and Up-to-Date

Verify that your local `develop` branch includes all intended features and is synchronized with the remote repository.

```bash title="Bash"
# Switch to the develop branch
git checkout develop

# Pull the latest changes from the remote develop branch
git pull origin develop
```

### Step 2: Create the Release Branch

Create the `release` branch from the current state of `develop`.

```bash title="Bash"

# Create the release branch from develop and switch to it
# Example: git checkout -b 20250514/rc develop
git checkout -b BRANCH_NAME develop
```

### Step 3: Prepare the Release on the `release` Branch

Finalize the release on this branch. Only release-specific changes should be made here â€“ no new features.

* Tasks:
    * Perform final testing.
    * Fix bugs for this release.
    * Update `CHANGELOG.md`
    * Update version number (pom.xml, package.json, etc.).

Update `CHANGELOG.md` by running `changeset version` in release branch. 
See this (https://github.com/changesets/changesets) for more information.

```bash title="Bash"
npx changeset version
```

Commit changes to `release` branch:

```bash title="Bash"
# --- Make necessary changes ---

# Stage the changes
git add .

# Commit the changes with descriptive messages
# Example: git commit -m "chore: Bump version to 1.2.0"
# Example: git commit -m "chore: Update CHANGELOG for v1.2.0"
# Example: git commit -m "fix: critical release bug #XYZ"
git commit -m "chore: Bump version to VERSION"
```


### Step 4: Push the Release Branch to GitHub

Push the `release` branch to `origin`. This makes it available for creating Pull Requests.

```bash title="Bash"
# Push the new release branch to origin and set upstream tracking
# Example: git push -u origin 20250415/rc
git push -u origin BRANCH_NAME
```

:::note
If further fixes are needed, commit them locally and push to origin/BRANCH_NAME again before proceeding.
:::


### Step 5: Finish Release - PR into `main`, Merge, Tag

Next, you need to create a Pull Request to merge `release` branch into `main`.

1. Create Pull Request to main:
    * Go to your repository on GitHub.
    * Navigate to the `Pull requests` tab and click `New pull request`.
    * Set the base branch to `main`.
    * Set the compare branch to `BRANCH_NAME` (e.g., 20250415/rc).
    * Review the changes and click "Create pull request". Fill in title and description.

:::warning Merge Conflict

In most cases, you will notice merge conflicts in the PR.
Rather than manually fixing the merge conflicts one at the time, you can perform the followings simplest and fastest way to resolve the conflicts:

1. Check out your `release` branch locally.
2. Update it (git pull).
3. Fetch `main` (git fetch origin main).
4. Merge main into develop using `git merge origin/main -X ours`
5. Push the updated `release` branch `git push origin BRANCH_NAME` (e.g., git push origin 20250415/rc) 
6. Merge the now conflict-free PR on GitHub.
:::

2. Review and Approve PR:
    * Team member review the code changes.
    * Ensure all required status checks (CI builds, tests) pass on the PR.
    
3. Merge the Pull Request into `main`:
    * If everything is in place, team member whom review the PR will approve and merges the PR using the GitHub UI.

:::danger Critical: Merge Method
Ensure the merge method selected is `Create a merge commit`. 

Do NOT use `Squash and merge` or `Rebase and merge` for merging release branches into main, as this deviates from the standard GitFlow history model. 
:::




### Step 6: Finish Release - PR back into develop

Use a Pull Request to merge the release preparations back into `develop`.

1. Create Pull Request to `develop`:
    * Go to your repository on GitHub.
    * Click `New pull request`.
    * Set the base branch to `develop`.
    * Set the compare branch to `BRANCH_NAME` (e.g., 20250415/rc).
    * Review the changes (primarily version bumps and fixes made during release prep) and click "Create pull request".

2. Review and Approve PR:
    * Team members review the changes.
    * Ensure CI checks pass.
    * Obtain approvals if required.

3. Merge the Pull Request into develop:
    * Team member whom review the chances merges the PR using the GitHub UI.

:::warning Merge Method Consistency
Use "Create a merge commit" here as well for consistency with GitFlow principles. Avoid squash/rebase.
:::

4. (Optional) Update local develop:

```bash title="Bash"
# Switch to the develop branch locally
git checkout develop

# Pull the latest changes, including the merge commit from GitHub
git pull origin develop
```

### Step 7: Create GitHub Release (UI Step)

This step will be repeated for each component to be released.

1. Navigate to the repository homepage on GitHub.
2. Click the "Releases" link.
3. Click "Draft a new release".
4. In the "Choose a tag" dropdown, enter the `COMPONENT_NAME/Version` for the component to release (e.g., gis-web/v1.2.0). Click on `+Create new tag ... on publish`.
5. In the "target" dropdown, make sure `main` is selected.
6. Enter a "Release title" (e.g., gis-web:v1.2.0).
7. Write detailed release notes.
8. (Optional) Attach build artifacts. If your component has API docs, they should be attached.
9. Click "Publish release".
