# FAQ

This section is meant to address and document common `questions`, `mistakes`, `errors`, and `pitfalls` that people might
run into. Apart from being a template, it also contains actual frequently asked questions with regarding to performing
documentation of AGIL Ops Hub with `Docusaurus`.

---

## How should I name my folders and markdown files?

All folder names and markdown files should be in `kebab-case`. Do not use numbers to order the folders in the
folder-browser. Keep the name of the folder similar to the title of the text in the sidebar that it represents so other
users can find the folder if they need to.

We don't use numbers to order them as it causes a lot of broken links when we attempt to do any re-ordering later.

Use the `sidebar_order` and `sidebar_label` front matter to control their position and label in the sidebar.

## Where should I put my images?

Store your images in the `static/img/**` folder. You should create folders that match where your docs are if have many
images (usually as part of a tutorial or guide) that are meant to be in a specific section/module.

We don't co-locate the images in with the docs they are used as they sometimes need to be shared. We'll keep things
simple by having them all in the `static/img/**` folder.

## How should I name my images?

Use `kebab-case` to name your images, give them a descriptive name as there will be many images in the docs, making
it difficult for you to find your image if your image name and description is too general.

## How should I show placeholder text in commands?

We have a class called `highlight` in the Docusaurus `custom.css` file that is meant to be used to highlight placeholder
text - that is text that the reader is meant to replace with their own values.

In order to be able to use this in code blocks, you can't use the usual triple backtick ` ``` ` syntax for code blocks,
you should use the `<CodeBlock>` component instead - an example is given below:

Actual Code:

```jsx title="CodeBlock jsx"
<CodeBlock language="bash">
	{`$ echo `}
	<span className="highlight">TOKEN</span>
	{` | docker login ghcr.io -u `}
	<span className="highlight">USERNAME</span>
	{` --password-stdin`}
</CodeBlock>

-   Replace <span className="highlight">TOKEN</span> with your token
-   Replace <span className="highlight">USERNAME</span> with your username
```

Render Output:

<CodeBlock language="bash" title="Render Output">
	{`$ echo `}
	<span className="highlight">TOKEN</span>
	{` | docker login ghcr.io -u `}
	<span className="highlight">USERNAME</span>
	{` --password-stdin`}
</CodeBlock>

-   Replace <span className="highlight">TOKEN</span> with your token
-   Replace <span className="highlight">USERNAME</span> with your username

## How should I create links to other docs in the same website?

### Linking versioned docs to versioned docs

This applies to all docs in `docs/versioned`:

Because we use Docusaurus' versioning system, all links that refer to **other docs** must use _relative file paths_ with
the file's extension.

```md
The [@hello](hello.mdx#paginate) document is great!

See the [Tutorial](../getting-started/tutorial.mdx) for more info.
```

For **collocated assets** (files placed adjacent or near-adjacent to the docs), use relative paths as well.

```md
![img alt](./myImage.png)

[download this file](./file.pdf)
```

For **global assets**, link to them using _absolute paths_.

```md
![img alt](/myImage.png)

[download this file](/file.pdf)
```

Docusaurus' official recommendations: https://docusaurus.io/docs/versioning#link-docs-by-file-paths

### Linking from unversioned to versioned docs

Some docs, such as `contributing` and `blog` articles should not be versioned, unversioned content can be found in the
following 2 locations:

1. `blog`
2. `docs/unversioned`

When linking to versioned docs from unversioned docs, these links must use the "resolved" Docusaurus path. This means
the path refers to the **path in the browser**, not in the project folder paths. So if the address bar reads
`https://mssfoobar.github.io/docs/2.0.0/overview/technologies/web`, `https://mssfoobar.github.io` is the origin and the
path to the `2.0.0` version's `Web Technologies` section is `/docs/2.0.0/overview/technologies/web`.

These links must always point to an absolute version (`2.0.0` in this example) of the website.

```md
[Web Technologies](/docs/2.0.0/overview/technologies/web)
```

:::note
Remeber to **EXCLUDE** the extension!
:::

### Linking to unversioned docs from elsewhere

All the docs in `docs/unversioned` has a base route of "stable". So instead of `http://mssfoobar.github.io/docs`, their
routes start at `http://mssfoobar.github.io/docs/stable`

```md
[changesets](/docs/stable/contributing/development/source-control#changesets)
```

:::danger
Failing to comply with these linking rules will give me great sadness because I'll have to adjust all the broken links
everytime we freeze a version of the site.

## How do I publish my module's Open API `.json` file?

In the `/static/open-api-json` folder, create a new folder with the shortname of your module (e.g. for Geospatial
Information Services, it would be `gis`), and paste your folder in there.

#### Example:

Link to GIS Open API Docs: [GIS Open API Docs](/open-api-json/gis/gis-api-docs.json)

Code to render the above example:

```md
Link to GIS Open API Docs: [GIS Open API Docs](/open-api-json/gis/gis-api-docs.json)
```

## Gists

If necessary and separate from the FAQ section, you can provide lists of commands, code recipes etc. here for users
to copy-paste. These should be very short sections.

The gists below is a set of useful Docusaurus references to help you with writing your documentation for Docusaurus and
is itself a good example of what `gists` should be.

## Docusaurus Reference

The following is a list of useful examples for reference when editing the markdown files on Docusaurus.

:::note

Formatting is very important for MDX: https://github.com/facebook/docusaurus/issues/3890
You must follow the formatting somewhat strictly (especially excluding spaces at the start of the sentence).

### [Images](https://docusaurus.io/docs/markdown-features/assets)

#### Markdown Syntax

![Svelte Logo](/img/sample.png)

Code to render above example:

```mdx
![Svelte Logo](/img/sample.png)
```

#### Ideal Image

Apart from using the markdown syntax to include images, you can include `<HTML>` directly, such as using the `<img />`
tag for `.mdx` files... or, you can use the `IdealImage`component from Docusaurus' `@theme/idealImage`. The advantage
of using ideal image is that generates low-quality placeholders, supports lazy loading, and handles responsiveness for
you. If you use `<img />` directly, you lose all that. Here is how you can render an image with `<IdealImage>`.

import IdealImage from "@theme/IdealImage";
import sampleImage from "@site/static/img/sample.png";

    <IdealImage img={sampleImage} />

```jsx title="Render Ideal Image Sample Code"
import IdealImage from "@theme/IdealImage";
import sampleImage from "@site/static/img/sample.png";

<IdealImage img={sampleImage} />;
```

#### Image Sizing & Centering

Ideal image tends to not give you the image size you want - you can wrap it with `<HTML>` to add whatever
style you want - in this example, we limit it to `325px` and add extra margins to the bottom.

You can also wrap it with a `<div>` with the class "centerize", which just `width: 100%` and flex center.

<div class="centerize">
	<div style={{ marginBottom: "2rem", marginTop: "2rem", maxWidth: "325px" }}>
		<IdealImage img={sampleImage} />
	</div>
</div>

```jsx title="Center "
<div class="centerize">
	<div style={{ marginBottom: "2rem", marginTop: "2rem", maxWidth: "325px" }}>
		<IdealImage img={sampleImage} />
	</div>
</div>
```

### [Tabs](https://docusaurus.io/docs/markdown-features/tabs)

{/* You must import the React components */}

import Tabs from "@theme/Tabs";
import TabItem from "@theme/TabItem";

<Tabs>
<TabItem value="Windows" label="Windows" default>

```bash
shutdown -t 0 -s
```

</TabItem>
<TabItem value="macOS" label="macOS">

```bash
sudo shutdown -h now
```

</TabItem>
<TabItem value="Linux" label="Linux">

```bash
sudo shutdown -h now
```

</TabItem>
</Tabs>

Code to render above example:

````md
<!-- You must import the React components -->

import Tabs from '@theme/Tabs';
import TabItem from '@theme/TabItem';

<Tabs>
<TabItem value="Windows" label="Windows" default>

```bash
shutdown -t 0 -s
```

</TabItem>
<TabItem value="macOS" label="macOS">
