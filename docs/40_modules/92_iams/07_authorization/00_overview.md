# Overview

With IAMS, project can choose to implement:
*	Basic Authorization
*	Fine-grained access control

IAMS provides necessary support to manage the permission and facilitate application in determining whether a user has access to application functionality. However, the enforcing of the decision will have to be implemented by the application.

For example, IAMS provides support to create Manager role and assign it to the user. IAMS also provide means to check whether user has the Manager role but enforcement of whether user with Manager role can perform specific action in the application, said approve submitted timesheet, will have to be implement by the application.
