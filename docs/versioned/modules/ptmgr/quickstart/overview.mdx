# Overview

This section provides instruction on how to set up local development environment for UNH module.

THe `Docker Compose` file to start up PTMGR module can be found under `ptmgr` directory in `dev-containers`
repository. For more information on `dev-containers`, please refer to
[Local Development](../../get-started/local-development.mdx).

To run PTMGR module, navigate to the `dev-containers` directory in your local machine and execute the
following:

```bash
podman compose --env-file .env -f ptmgr/compose.yml up -d
```

# Accessing PTMGR

Once the services are up, you should be able to access the API at `http://ptmgr.{DEV_DOMAIN}`

`{DEV_DOMAIN}` is defined in the .env file at the root folder. For example, if your domain is 127.0.0.1.nip.io, then the
URL of the PTMGR http server will be at http://ptmgr.127.0.0.1.nip.io
