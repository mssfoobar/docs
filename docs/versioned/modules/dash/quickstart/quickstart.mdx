# Dashboard Module Quickstart

Get started with the Dashboard (DASH) module to create and manage interactive dashboards with customizable widgets in your web application.

## Prerequisites

The following section assumes you have installed all the tools required for web development from our [tools section](../../get-started/tools.mdx).

Before you move on, it is also **mandatory** that you read through the key technology list in our [web technologies](/overview/technologies/web.md) section and you understand the justification for each one, especially if you're not familiar with the specific technology.

:::info
It is presumed that you already have a `Web Base` prepared and ready for you to install modlets, otherwise, please go to the [Web Framework quickstart section](../../web-base/quickstart/quickstart.mdx) to initialize your `Web Base`.

It is also presumed that you are already familiar with running a local development environment, otherwise, please go to the [Local Dev Environment](../../get-started/local-development.mdx) to prepare your machine for local development.
:::

## Installation

### 1. Install the DASH Modlet

Run the following command in the root of your `Web Base` project:

```bash title="web-base"
npx cli install dash
```

You'll be prompted to choose your 'root folder' - use the default (current working directory).

The modlet will be installed with:
- Dashboard components and widgets
- Navigation configuration
- Type definitions and services
- Dependencies added to your package.json

### 2. Configure Environment Variables

Add the required environment variables to your `.env` file:

```bash title=".env"
## ==================== DASH ====================
# URL of the dashboard service (required)
DASH_URL=http://dash.127.0.0.1.nip.io
# URL of the tag service (required)  
TAG_URL=http://tag.127.0.0.1.nip.io
```

These default values work with the standard development setup using `127.0.0.1.nip.io`. Adjust them according to your environment.

For detailed information about each environment variable, see the [configuration section](../configuration/configuration.mdx#environment-variables).

### 3. Start Backend Services

Start the required backend services using the development containers:

<Tabs>
<TabItem value="podman" label="Podman">

```bash title="dev-containers"
podman compose --env-file .env -f dash/compose.yml up -d
```

</TabItem>
<TabItem value="docker" label="Docker">

```bash title="dev-containers"
docker compose --env-file .env -f dash/compose.yml up -d
```

</TabItem>
</Tabs>

:::tip
Remember to adjust and add the `compose.override.yml` if you have specific requirements like exposing the database for direct connection from database management tools.
:::

### 4. Start Development Server

```bash title="web-base"
npm run dev
```

## Using the Dashboard Module

Once installed and running, you can access the dashboard functionality:

### Navigation

The DASH module adds navigation items to your application:

- **Dashboard Management** (`/aoh/dash`) - Main dashboard management interface
- **Favorite Dashboards** (`/aoh/dash/favourite`) - Quick access to favorited dashboards

### Creating Your First Dashboard

1. **Navigate to Dashboard Management** - Visit `/aoh/dash` in your application
2. **Create New Dashboard** - Click "Create Dashboard" and provide:
   - Dashboard name and description
   - Initial layout configuration
   - Optional tags for organization
3. **Add Widgets** - Use the widget selector to add components:
   - Position widgets using the grid system
   - Configure widget properties
   - Resize widgets as needed
4. **Save and Test** - Save your dashboard and test the functionality

### Basic Dashboard Component Usage

You can also use dashboard components directly in your custom pages:

```typescript title="src/routes/my-page/+page.svelte"
<script lang="ts">
  import { DashboardGrid, Widget } from '$lib/aoh/dash/components';
  
  const dashboardConfig = {
    name: "My Custom Dashboard",
    widgets: [
      {
        type: "Info",
        config: {
          title: "System Status",
          value: "Online",
          subtitle: "All systems operational"
        },
        position: { row: 0, column: 0, width: 6, height: 4 }
      }
    ]
  };
</script>

<DashboardGrid config={dashboardConfig} />
```
