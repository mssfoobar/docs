# Dashboard Module Quickstart

Get started with the Dashboard (DASH) module to create and manage interactive dashboards with customizable widgets in your web application.

## Prerequisites

The following section assumes you have installed all the tools required for web development from our [tools section](../../get-started/tools.mdx).

Before you move on, it is also **mandatory** that you read through the key technology list in our [web technologies](/overview/technologies/web.md) section and you understand the justification for each one, especially if you're not familiar with the specific technology.

:::info
It is presumed that you already have a `web-base` prepared and ready for you to install modlets, otherwise, please go to the [Web-base quickstart section](../../web-base/quickstart/quickstart.mdx) to initialize your `web-base`.

Alternatively, you can clone the web-base repository:
```bash
git clone https://github.com/mssfoobar/web-base.git
cd web-base
npm install
```
:::

## Frontend Setup

### 1. Install the DASH Modlet

Run the following command in the root of your `web-base` project:

```bash title="web-base/web/.env"
npx cli install dash
```

You'll be prompted to choose your 'root folder' - use the default (current working directory).

The modlet will be installed with:
- Dashboard components and widgets
- Navigation configuration
- Type definitions and services
- Dependencies added to your package.json

### 2. Configure Environment Variables

Add the required environment variables to your `.env` file:

```bash title="web-base/.env"
## ==================== DASH ====================
# URL of the dashboard service (required)
DASH_URL=http://dash.127.0.0.1.nip.io
# URL of the tag service (required)
TAG_URL=http://tag.127.0.0.1.nip.io
```

These default values work with the standard development setup using `127.0.0.1.nip.io`. Adjust them according to your environment.

For detailed information about each environment variable, see the [configuration section](../configuration/configuration.mdx#environment-variables).

### 3. Start Development Server

```bash title="web-base"
npm run dev
```

The frontend will be available at `http://localhost:5173` (default Vite port).

## Backend Setup

### 1. Configure Docker Environment Variables

Copy the environment template for Docker services:

```bash title="dash"
cp app/docker/.env.template app/docker/.env
```

Edit `app/docker/.env` and set the required passwords:

```bash
DEV_PASSWORD=your_password_here
DEV_PASSWORD_URL_ENCODED=your_url_encoded_password_here
```

:::warning
You must specify both `DEV_PASSWORD` and `DEV_PASSWORD_URL_ENCODED` for the application to function properly. The URL-encoded version is required for database connection strings with special characters.
:::

:::tip
Optionally, copy the compose override template to customize database port mappings:
```bash
cp app/docker/compose.override.sample.yml app/docker/compose.override.yml
```
:::

### 2. Start Dependency Services

Start the required infrastructure and services (Traefik, Keycloak, Tag service, databases):

```bash title="dash"
npm run docker:start
```

This will start:
- **Traefik** - Reverse proxy for service routing
- **IAMs Keycloak** - Authentication and authorization service
- **Tag Service** - Tag management service
- **PostgreSQL databases** - For Keycloak, Tag service, and Dashboard

### 3. Run Backend Service

**3.1 Setup Backend Environment**

Copy the backend environment template:
```bash title="dash"
cp app/.env.template app/.env
```

**3.2 Configure Required Variables**

Edit `app/.env` and set the following:
```bash
DEV_PASSWORD=your_password_here
DEV_PASSWORD_URL_ENCODED=your_url_encoded_password_here
```

:::warning
Ensure `DEV_PASSWORD` and `DEV_PASSWORD_URL_ENCODED` match the passwords specified in `app/docker/.env` from Step 1.
:::

**3.3 Start the Backend Service**

```bash title="dash/app"
go mod tidy
go run cmd/dash/main.go
```

## Using the Dashboard Module

Once installed and running, you can access the dashboard functionality:

### Navigation

The DASH module adds navigation items to your application:

- **Dashboard Management** (`/aoh/dash`) - Main dashboard management interface
- **Favorite Dashboards** (`/aoh/dash/favourite`) - Quick access to favorited dashboards

### Creating Your First Dashboard

1. **Navigate to Dashboard Management** - Visit `/aoh/dash` in your application
2. **Create New Dashboard** - Click "Create Dashboard" and provide:
   - Dashboard name and description
   - Initial layout configuration
   - Optional tags for organization
3. **Add Widgets** - Use the widget selector to add components:
   - Position widgets using the grid system
   - Configure widget properties
   - Resize widgets as needed
4. **Save and Test** - Save your dashboard and test the functionality


## Next Steps

- **Explore Widget Development**: Learn how to create custom widgets in the [development guide](../development/development.mdx)
- **Configure Advanced Features**: Set up advanced dashboard features in the [configuration section](../configuration/configuration.mdx)
- **Deploy to Production**: Follow the [deployment guide](../deployment/deployment.mdx) for production setup
- **Review Reference Pages**: Check the FAQ and troubleshooting guides in the reference section
