## @mssfoobar/sse-client

### [1.2.0](https://github.com/mssfoobar/aoh-web-lib/releases/tag/sse-client%2Fv1.2.0)

#### Minor Changes

-   Added heartbeat monitoring mechanism to detect stale connections
    -   New config option: `heartbeatTimeout` - Duration in milliseconds to wait for messages before triggering timeout
    -   New callback: `onHeartbeatTimeout(timeSinceLastMessage)` - Called when no messages received within timeout period
    -   Timer resets on ANY message received including server keepalive events
    -   Added "keepalive" to EventName type for server heartbeat/ping events
    -   Dedicated keepalive event listener automatically resets heartbeat timer
    -   Automatic cleanup on disconnect and errors
    -   Recommended: Set `heartbeatTimeout` to 2-3× server heartbeat interval

-   Fixed `onAnyEvent` callback to actually capture ALL events
    -   Previously only called for unnamed/default SSE events
    -   Now called for all events: named events (Added, Removed, Updated, Timeout, keepalive) AND unnamed events
    -   Execution order: `onAnyEvent` fires first, then specific event handler (if configured)
    -   Added comprehensive JSDoc documentation explaining behavior
    -   Includes keepalive events by default (developers can filter if needed)
    -   Centralized event processing with consistent error handling
    -   Type-safe: `onAnyEvent` only receives successfully parsed JSON data

-   Added `JsonMapBasedSSEClientConfig` to public type exports for better type checking
