# Deployment

This section includes deployment configuration considerations for production environments. The `Web Base` is a
Svelte Kit application - [Svelte Kit supplies "adapters"](https://svelte.dev/docs/kit/adapters) to build the server for
different platforms.

Since AGIL Ops Hub is designed for enterprise application purposes, we use the `adapter-node` by default (to run it as
a Node server) which can then be containerized and deployed in Kubernetes clusters. However, you are free to try
other adapters if it suites your projects needs.

:::tip
Additional Svelte Node server related configuration considerations can be found
[here](https://svelte.dev/docs/kit/adapter-node).

Anyone deploying the node server **MUST** be familiar with those considerations as in the enterprise context,
applications are typically deployed behind firewalls, reverse proxies, and load balancers, which might require special
considerations for the forwarding of headers, specifying of `ORIGIN` etc.

## Deployment Architecture

By default, the `Web Base` only needs to be connected to the `IAMS`. However, as you include more modlets or create
more endpoints that requires aggregating calls from your other backend services, you'll need to cater for that and
add those URL's to your deployment configuration accordingly.

This diagram also shows the `Ingress Controller` using `hostname` based routing - we use
[Traefik](https://traefik.io/traefik/) in our own practice, but projects might have their own designs for routing (based
on their choice of reverse proxy and infrastructure requirements). You do not have route your requests in this manner if
you want, however, take note that there are [special considerations with Keycloak when putting it behind a reverse
proxy](https://www.keycloak.org/server/reverseproxy#_configure_the_reverse_proxy_headers). You will have to understand
and design your architecture around the `IAMS's` and `Keycloak's` deployment requirements.

## Security Considerations

### External vs Internal URL for `IAM_URL`

The `IAM_URL` is essentially the issuer URL - which is the URL to the specific realm you are connecting to in Keycloak
(because the `IAMS` uses Keycloak as the identity provider service). One important security consideration is that the
web server should always conenct to Keycloak using the internal address, and yet, it should allow the client/browser
to connect to Keycloak via the external address (this is necessary for the Authorization Code Flow as the web server
will have to redirect the client to Keycloak's login page).

This is possible because the OIDC standard supports a discovery endpoint (`.well-known/openid-configuration`) to provide
the issuer endpoint. Keycloak has support to distinguish frontchannel and backchannel endpoints, and can return
different URL's in the discovery response based on specific configurations.

It is recommended that you set the `IAM_URL` to your **internal** address for Keycloak, and add the
`.well-known/openid-configuration` for the web server's
[OIDC client to avoid extra issuer checks](../configuration/configuration.mdx#iam_url).

### Connecting to the `IAM_URL` without `HTTPS`

As mentioned in the
[`OIDC_ALLOW_INSECURE_REQUESTS`](../configuration/configuration.mdx#oidc_allow_insecure_requests)
configuration, if your internal communications do not use HTTPS, you will have to set this value to `"1"`. This is a
common setup for infrastructures with TLS termination at your load balancer.

## Liveness and Readiness Endpoints

The `Web Base` comes with a `/livez` and `/readyz` endpoint:

-   `src/routes/(public)/(health)/livez`
-   `src/routes/(public)/(health)/readyz`

These endpoints exist for your [Kubernetes readines and liveness probes](https://kubernetes.io/docs/tasks/configure-pod-container/configure-liveness-readiness-startup-probes/)
to connect to to determine if the system is alive, and if it is ready to accept connections.

### Liveness

By default, the `livez` endpoint provides basic server health information, such as the process uptime, server time,
and memory usage. If these information are sensitive, they should be **REMOVED** from the `livez` endpoint as it is
public. Alternatively, you may move the endpoint to a private section but come up with a different authorization system
to only allow the relevant parties (Kubernetes in this case) to access the endpoint.

### Readiness

The `readyz` endpoint returns the status code 200 (OK) if it is ready, or status code 423 (Locked) if it is not ready.
This is useful for Kubernetes' readiness probe to determine if the application is ready to receive connections.

By default, there is a `isServerReady` function that you can use to implement some logic to determine if your
web server is ready to receive requests. For example, if you have additional steps to the startup process, such as
connecting to a database to retrieve configuration information etc. You should implement those checks in the provided
`isServerReady` function.
