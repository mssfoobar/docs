# CLI (Command-line Interface)

We offer a CLI tool to simplify and facilitate installation and publishing of modules with the `Web Base`. The tool
comes pre-installed as a dependency in the `Web Base`.

## Commands

To view the commands available, run:

```bash title="web-base/web"
cli
```

:::info
If "cli" is an unknown command, you might have to run `npx cli` instead of `cli` or, run `npm install` first, because
the CLI tool might not already be in your local or global `node_modules` folder.
:::

The current list of commands are:

-   [init](#init)
-   [install](#install)
-   [pack](#pack)
-   [publish](#publish)

### `init`

The `init` command is to help you get started when using the `Web Base`. You should modify the default `package.json`
to your liking, but the `init` command basically helps you get started.

:::info
We'll be adding more steps to the init in the future to make the new project creation even simpler and quicker.
:::

### `install`

Modules that come with web components can be installed using this CLI tool via the "install" command. Running `install`
for a chosen module will install all its required dependencies (via `npm install`), as well as copy out its respective
component source code to your `Web Base`, and perform any additional module-specific steps that can be done
automatically.

For example, to install the `Incident Management System (IMS)`, run this command:

```bash title="web-base/web"
npx cli install ims
```

Alternatively, you can just run `cli install` to get a list of all the modlets you can install, when you can then
choose from:

```bash title="web-base/web"
npx cli install
```

You can also specify the specific version tag for the modlet you want by passing in the `-t` flag:

```bash title="web-base/web"
npx cli install rnr -t 1.0.3
```

The value supplied to the `-t` flag is appended to the `npm install <package>@<version>` command, replacing `<version>`
see [npm-install](https://docs.npmjs.com/cli/v9/commands/npm-install#description), so versions like `latest` will work
as well.

### `pack`

The package command is used to help package web **modules** into an publishable folder, and publish it to the
desired `npm` package registry.

:::tip
You only need this command if you're contributing modules back to our system - please
ensure you have read the [Modlet Development](/stable/contributing/development/module-development) section
before continuing.
:::

-   **Package Name**: This corresponds to your module name, and the folder you place all your module files in
    ([for example see "bar" here](/docs/stable/contributing/development/module-development#cli-tool-packaging-requirements))
-   **Project Name**: The name of your project - this is always `aoh` when performing development for AGIL Ops Hub
    modules ([for example see "foo" here](/docs/stable/contributing/development/module-development#cli-tool-packaging-requirements)).
-   **Web Folder**: This is the folder of the web project that you're trying to package.
-   **package.json**: The absolute path to the `package.json` file, which ensures that the package has the necessary
    dependencies. The manager takes your package.json and constructs its own to ensure that it has the
    necessary dependencies.
-   **Lib Folder**: The absolute path to the lib folder containing all your web components and libraries. The default
    assumes it will be in `src/lib/<project-name>/<module-name>`.
-   **Public & Private Route Folders**: These are the absolute paths to the public and private route folders - your
    modules may have API routes that need to be called and these steps allow you to include them in your package. The
    installation step will later copy these out for the developers, following the same folder structure.
-   **npm package registry URL**: The final steps is to confirm the repository URL for your package - the tool is
    currently built to support publishing to `GitHub Packages`.

```bash title="web-base/web"
npx cli pack
```

If this is successful, there will be a `.mod` folder with all your exported files and folders inside at the root of your
directory. This is published to the URL supplied during packing.

:::note
The **.mod** folder is used the publishing step and can be deleted when your package has been published.
:::

### `publish`

The `publish` command is designed to run with the `pack` command. After running `pack`, you can run `npx cli publish` to
publish the created `.mod` folder.

```bash title="web-base/web"
npx cli publish
```
