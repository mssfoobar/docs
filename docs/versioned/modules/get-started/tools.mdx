# Tools

This section provides information on some of the recommended tools to use for development.

## Git

[Git](https://git-scm.com/) is a distributed version control system that is widely used in the industry for tracking changes in source code
during software development.

In AGIL Ops Hub, we are using Git and [GitHub Repositories](https://docs.github.com/en/repositories) as the central repository for our own
source control.
It is recommended that the project should use Git for version control and central repository server such as GitHub or Gitlab, to facilitate
source collaboration among project members.

Follow the guide on [GitHub's Git Guides](https://github.com/git-guides/install-git) for thorough instructions on how to install Git on
Windows, MacOS and Linux.

## Docker Engine / Podman

AGIL Ops Hub is designed to operate in a `containerized environment`. For development, developers will need development
tools, such as `Docker Engine`, for creating, sharing and running individual containers.

For developers using `Linux` or `Mac`, the installation steps are pretty straightforward, and can be found in
[here](https://docs.docker.com/engine/install/).

:::note
For computers on the `ARM` architecture (such as with `Apple Silicon`), the container image created will be `ARM` based and will not able to run in `x86-64` architecture.

To build `x86-64` container images, you will need to use `Docker Buildx` which is included in Docker Engine v20.x or
later. Refer to
[Building x86 Images on an Apple M1 Chip](https://everythingdevops.dev/building-x86-images-on-an-apple-m1-chip/) for
more information.
:::

For developers using `Windows` machines that wish to build `Linux` containers, they will need to set up `WSL2` or
a `Linux VM`. A simpler approach would be to use `Podman Desktop` instead, a good open-source alternative to
`Docker Desktop` which is **NOT FREE** for non-personal use.

Refer to [Installing Podman Desktop and Podman on Windows](https://podman-desktop.io/docs/installation/windows-install)
for installation instructions.

:::note
To run `podman compose`, you must perform additional set up steps, refer to the following link for
more details: https://podman-desktop.io/docs/compose/setting-up-compose

## Visual Studio Code

### Extensions

We highly recommend using [Visual Studio Code (aka VS Code)](https://code.visualstudio.com/) installed with the
following extensions:

#### Frontend

-   [Svelte for VS Code](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=svelte.svelte-vscode)  
    The Svelte extension provides code colouring and IntelliSense for Svelte, which itself is similar to jsx/tsx.
-   [ESLint](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=dbaeumer.vscode-eslint)  
    The ESLint extension will provide ESLint information as you code - when linting is enforced in the CI, you will
    have to adhere to the standards before your code is merged - this extension will help with that.
-   [Prettier - Code formatter](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=esbenp.prettier-vscode)
    Prettier handles formatting - our files should all be automatically formatted the same way - in the future, we
    might integrate this into CI/CD.
-   [Tailwind CSS IntelliSense](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=bradlc.vscode-tailwindcss)  
    The Tailwind CSS IntelliSense extension provides IntelliSense for Tailwind CSS.

#### Backend

-   Golang: https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=golang.go
-   Extension Pack for Java: https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=vscjava.vscode-java-pack
-   Spring Boot Extension Pack: https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=vmware.vscode-boot-dev-pack

#### Code Quality

-   [SonarQube for IDE](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=SonarSource.sonarlint-vscode)
    This extension actively scans our code and shows us issues before we even commit anything. It is a powerful linter
    that highlights common poor practices and is a godsend for keep code quality high.
-   [Snyk Security](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=snyk-security.snyk-vulnerability-scanner)
    We use Syn Security primarily for scanning our packages early and informing us to fix them before even getting
    into the CI.

#### Misc

-   [Docker](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=ms-azuretools.vscode-docker)  
    The Docker extension provides Docker functionality in VS Code, including and especially IntelliSense for
    Dockerfiles.

### Format On Save

We highly recommend you enable `Format On Save`. You can press `Ctrl + P` and type `Open User Settings` to
navigate to the user settings page, then type `format on save` and the relevant setting will show up:

### Recommended Extensions

These are some extremely helpful extensions for Visual Studio Code and are integral to the development experience.

Install the Official Extensions:

-   [Playwright Test for VSCode](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=ms-playwright.playwright)  
    The Playwright Test extension allows you to debug Playwright Tests, record new tests, tune selectors, run
    individual tests, and more.

### Tailwind IntelliSense Hinters

You can get IntelliSense for Tailwind CSS classes in VS Code for arbitrary contexts (other than just `class="..."`) with
some extra configuration:

We use `/* @tw */` comments to indicate that the following line of code is a Tailwind CSS class. To enable that
configuration, add the following line to your VS Code settings. After which, adding /_ @tw _/ above variables you
declare will have Tailwind IntelliSense.

```json
"tailwindCSS.experimental.classRegex": [
    "/\\*\\s*@tw\\s*\\*/[^\"]+\"([^\"]*)\"",
    "/\\*\\s*@tw\\s*\\*/[^']+'([^']*)'",
]
```

:::note
You can modify the regex to fit your own needs, but we recommend standardizing it so it works for all of us.
:::

### Tailwind IntelliSense on Custom Attributes

You should also configure the Tailwind VS Code extension's `Class Attributes`:

![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/5701052/183502683-68957638-d54f-4da1-b60d-151c694ae83c.png)

Customizing this setting will allow custom component props to have Tailwind IntelliSense.

## Node.js

For frontend development, you will need to install [Node.JS](https://nodejs.org/en/download/) version 20 or above.

For `Windows` machines, the easiest way to install is to use the official Windows installer which you can get from the
[official website](https://nodejs.org/en/download/).

As for `Linux` and `Mac`, you can use their respective package managers to perform the installation.
Refer to [Installing Node.js via Package Managers](https://nodejs.org/en/download/package-manager/all#installing-nodejs-via-package-managers) for more information.

## Golang

If you are using golang for backend development or developing custom `Workflow Activities`, you will need to install
golang using instructions found in [download and install](https://go.dev/doc/install).

## Java

If you are using Spring Boot for backend development, you will need to install the Java JDK. We recommend using OpenJD
instead of Oracle Java SDK. Azul Systems provides an OpenJDK build for many OS's and platforms; refer to
https://docs.azul.com/core/install/docker for instructions on how to install the OpenJDK on your required platform.
