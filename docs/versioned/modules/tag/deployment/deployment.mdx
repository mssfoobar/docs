The `TAG` service comprises of the backend server and database. The following diagram shows the `TAG` and its
dependencies.

## Deployment Artifacts

### GIS:

-   Service Container:

    `ghcr.io/mssfoobar/tag/tag-app:v1.0.0`

-   Database:

    The `TAG` requires its own schema in a Postgres database, we recommend using the shortname of the module for the
    name of the schema (`tag`).

You can find the available configuration parameters at the
[`configuration section`](../configuration/configuration.mdx) and real examples at the `GIS` compose
section of the [`dev-containers`](https://github.com/mssfoobar/dev-containers/blob/develop/gis/compose.yml) repository.

### Others (Dependencies):

The `TAG` requires the `IAMS` service to function properly as it uses the service for authentication.
