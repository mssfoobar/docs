# Configuration

In a production environment, your application server would typically be run containerized in a Docker or Kubernetes
context. As such, environment variables would either be set by your `Docker Compose` files, or `Kubernetes` deployment
manifests.

## Service Environment Variables

The following is the list of environment variables used by the `TAG` service.

| Environment Variable                              | Example Value                          |

### `APP_PORT`

<details>
	<summary>The server HTTP port to serve requests on</summary>
	<div>
		This should be any valid port number (1 to 65536).
    </div>

</details>

### `LOG_LEVEL`

<details>
	<summary>The log level to use</summary>
	<div>
		This currently only accepts "debug". If set to debug, the logger will be configured to run at "development"
        mode, which essentially logs at debug level. Any other value will cause it to run at "production" mode, which
        logs at the info level.
    </div>

</details>

### `SQL_HOST`

<details>
	<summary>The hostname for the database to use in the database connection string</summary>
	<div>
		This is the hostname in the URL used to connect to the database, a database connection string will be
        constructed based on this.
    </div>

</details>

### `SQL_PORT`

<details>
	<summary>The port for the database to use in the database connection string</summary>
	<div>
		This is the port in the URL used to connect to the database, a database connection string will be
        constructed based on this.
    </div>

</details>

### `SQL_DATABASE_NAME`

<details>
	<summary>The name of the database to connect to</summary>
	<div>
		This is the name of the database to connect to, a database connection string will be
        constructed based on this.
    </div>

</details>

### `SQL_USER`

<details>
	<summary>The username of the account used to connect to the database</summary>
	<div>
		This is the user account used to connect to the database, a database connection string will be
        constructed based on this.
    </div>

</details>

### `SQL_PASSWORD`

<details>
	<summary>The password of the account used to connect to the database</summary>
	<div>
		This is the password of the account used to connect to the database, a database connection string will be
        constructed based on this.
    </div>

</details>

### `SQL_PLUGIN_NAME`

<details>
	<summary>The SQL database plugin name - determines which driver and database implementation to use</summary>
	<div>
		Currently, only `postgresql` is supported.
    </div>

</details>

### `SQL_MAX_CONNS`

<details>
	<summary>This parameter defines the absolute maximum number of connections that can be simultaneously active
         (both in-use and idle) in the connection pool.</summary>
	<div>
		 Once this limit is reached, new requests for connections will
         be typically have to wait until a connection becomes available or may be rejected if a timeout is exceeded.

        <strong>Impact on Performance:</strong>
        <ul>
            <li>Too Low: If set too low, your application might frequently block while waiting for a connection, leading
            to increased latency and potentially unresponsive behavior under load. Requests might queue up or fail.</li>
            <li>Too High: While it might seem like a higher limit is always better, an excessively high number can
            overwhelm the database server. Each connection consumes resources (memory, CPU) on the database server.
            Too many concurrent connections can lead to resource contention, increased context switching, and degraded
            database performance. It can also exhaust available resources on the database server.</li>
        </ul>
        <strong>Impact on Resource Utilization:</strong>
        Directly correlates with the maximum potential resource usage on the database server. Higher values mean more
        memory and process/thread capacity allocated by the database to handle connections.

</div>

</details>

### `SQL_MAX_IDLE_CONNS`

<details>
	<summary>This parameter specifies the maximum number of connections that the pool will keep open and idle, ready
    for immediate use. If the number of idle connections exceeds this value, the pool manager may close the excess idle connections.</summary>
	<div>
		<strong>Impact on Performance:</strong>
        <ul>
            <li>
                Too Low: If set too low (or lower than typical concurrent needs), the application might often need to
                establish new connections when a burst of requests arrives, incurring the overhead and latency of connection
                creation.
            </li>
            <li>
                Too High: Maintaining a large number of idle connections consumes resources both in the application
                (memory for the pool) and on the database server (which keeps these connections open). While it ensures
                connections are readily available, if they remain unused for long periods, it's an inefficient use of
                resources. Some pools might close connections that are idle for too long regardless of this setting
                (see Idle Timeout).
            </li>
        </ul>
        <strong>Impact on Resource Utilization:</strong>
Determines the baseline resource consumption by the connection pool when the application is not actively using all connections. Higher values mean more resources are kept reserved.
    </div>

</details>

### `SQL_MAX_CONN_LIFETIME`

<details>
	<summary>
        This setting dictates the maximum duration a connection can exist in the pool, regardless of whether it's
        idle or in use. After a connection reaches this lifetime, it will be gracefully closed and removed from the pool
        when it's returned.
    </summary>
	<div>
		<strong>Impact on Performance:</strong>
        <ul>
            <li>
                Too Short: Frequent cycling of connections can increase the rate of new connection establishments,
                adding slight overhead. However, it can also help in distributing load across database nodes in a
                clustered environment or prevent connections from becoming stale due to network or server-side changes.
            </li>
            <li>
                Too Long: Long-lived connections might hold onto outdated server resources or configurations. In
                environments with firewalls that have strict idle timeout policies, a very long lifetime might lead to
                connections being dropped by the network, causing errors. It can also lead to memory leaks or resource
                consumption issues on the database server over extended periods.
            </li>
        </ul>
        <strong>Impact on Resource Utilization:</strong>
        Helps in preventing resource exhaustion from very old connections that might have accumulated state or
        encountered issues. It ensures connections are periodically refreshed, potentially freeing up resources on the
        database server that might not be properly released by older connections. CockroachDB, for instance,
        recommends a lifetime between 5 and 30 minutes to help with node shutdowns or restarts.
    </div>

</details>

### `IAM_URL`

<details>
	<summary>
        This must be the OIDC Issuer URL. In AGIL Ops Hub, you can treat this as the URL to the Keycloak server with
        the realm path.
    </summary>
	<div>        
        See https://openid.net/specs/openid-connect-core-1_0.html#IssuerIdentifier for more information.
    </div>
