# Quickstart

The tag module is a simple service. You can start it using the `dev-containers`. The setup instructions for the local
development environment is listed in [Local Dev Environment](../../get-started/local-development.mdx).

To start the `tag` service, make sure you've set up the `dev-containers` repository locally, then run:

```bash title="dev-containers"
podman compose --env-file .env -f tag/compose.yml up -d
```

For information on how you can make use of the `tag` service, refer to the
[development section](../development/development.mdx).
