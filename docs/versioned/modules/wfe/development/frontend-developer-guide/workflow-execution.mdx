# Workflow Execution

Workflow Execution is the actual running workflow instance in the Workflow Engine.

## Start Workflow

To start a new workflow execution, make a `POST` HTTP request to `{WFM_URL}/v1/workflow` with the following
parameters in the request body:

-   `template_id` - ID of the workflow template.
-   `metadata` - Metadata of the workflow. It is a key-value map which can be accessed inside the workflow activity.

:::info
Refer to [retrieving workflow metadata guide](../activity-developer-guide/activity-development.mdx#retrieving-workflow-metadata)
for how to retrieve workflow metadata inside the activity.

}
```

The response body contains

-   `workflow_id` - ID of the new workflow execution.

:::tip
If your frontend application is integrating with other systems, you can persist the `workflow_id` in your system's
database to track the workflow execution.
:::

## Terminate Workflow

Make a `DELETE` HTTP request to `{WFM_URL}/v1/workflow/{workflow_id}` with the optional request body
field `reason` for termination. `{workflow_id}` is the ID of the workflow execution to terminate.
