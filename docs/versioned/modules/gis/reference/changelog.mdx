### [v2.0.2](https://github.com/mssfoobar/gis/releases/tag/gis-app%2Fv2.0.2)

#### Patch Changes

-   Added @Transactional annotations to save() and saveAll() methods in GeoEntityService to ensure RTUS PMS failures trigger database transaction rollbacks.
-   **Dependencies**: Upgraded Spring Boot to 3.5.8 (Fixes multiple CVEs).
-   **Fixes & Quality**: Prevented accidental API exposure; added Deepcode annotations and refactored batch sync logic.
-   **Tests**: Added unit tests for GIS-RTUS sync functionality and fixed GlobalExceptionHandlerTest.
-   **Documentation**: Added OpenAPI/Swagger docs for core controllers and dynamic versioning config.


### [v2.0.1](https://github.com/mssfoobar/gis/releases/tag/gis-app%2Fv2.0.1)

#### Patch Changes

-   9823835: Updated Java dependencies to resolve vulnerability assessment issues.

### [v2.0.0](https://github.com/mssfoobar/gis/releases/tag/gis-app%2Fv2.0.0)

#### Major Changes

-   807a42c: Added "entity_id" field to allow developers to use their own unique identifier for entities. Also added batch endpoints for efficient updates.

#### Minor Changes

-   ed31a74: Added `/geoentity/id/batch` and `/geoentity/entity_id/batch` endpoints to allow passing in lists of ID's to delete geoentities.
-   976a07c: Modified the RTUS integration to use the new `json-map` feature, which allows JSON objects to be filtered.
-   5f4cfe9: Added the "puts-ignore-occ-lock" flag (environment variable) to allow upsert (PUT) endpoints to not require the occ_lock field.

#### Patch Changes

-   74684aa: Significantly improved batch performance by doing batch entity lookup instead of individual lookup.
-   807a42c: Added a 'put' endpoint which allows upserting.
-   4f955b6: Skip unnecessary call to RTUS PMS to delete geoentities when list is empty.

### [v1.0.0](https://github.com/mssfoobar/gis/releases/tag/gis-service%2Fv1.0.0)

#### Major Changes

-   e2c02be: Added "entity_id" field to allow developers to use their own unique identifier for entities. Also added batch endpoints for efficient updates.

## @mssfoobar/gis-web

### [v1.3.0](https://github.com/mssfoobar/gis/releases/tag/gis-web%2Fv1.3.0)

#### Minor Changes

-   072ecf2: Add comprehensive measurement and arrow animation features with UI integrations

##### Measurement Features
-   **Core Functions**: Comprehensive tools for distance (geodesic/Euclidean), area, perimeter, and bearing calculations. Supports complex geometries including polylines, polygons, circles, and ellipses.
-   **Advanced Analysis**: Includes elevation profiling, buffer creation, intersection detection, and point-at-offset calculations.
-   **Unified UI**: logical panel integration with context menus, interactive modes (snap-to-entity, dynamic updates), and real-time result visualization.

##### Arrow Animation Features
-   **Rendering System**: Efficient custom arrow placement on LineStrings with multiple styles (filled, outline, chevron) and cached calculations.
-   **Animation Modes**: Supports Flow, Conveyor, and Trailing effects with configurable speed and direction.
-   **Performance & UI**: Comprehensive settings panel with quality presets (Low to Ultra), real-time FPS monitoring, and smart limit warnings.

-   **Connectivity & Visualization** (1695cc0):
    -   Upgraded SSE client to v1.2.0 with heartbeat monitoring and added a persistent "Connection Lost" dialog.
    -   Disabled SSR for GIS page to ensure robust browser-only Cesium rendering.

-   **Security & Build** (176600f):
    -   Resolved npm/glob vulnerabilities by separating build-time dependencies.
    -   Optimized production Dockerfile: removed npm CLI, utilized distroless base, and fixed Linux WebGL dependencies.

#### Patch Changes

-   **Reliability**: Improved SSE state synchronization (pull initial state on connect) to prevent race conditions and missing events (RTUS-SEH).
-   **Fixes**:
    -   Resolved Svelte 5 "binding_property_non_reactive" and hydration mismatch warnings.
    -   Fixed SSE client double-instantiation.
    -   Set "Aircraft" as default entity layer.


### [v1.2.0](https://github.com/mssfoobar/gis/releases/tag/gis-web%2Fv1.2.0)

#### Minor Changes

-   a0434ae: Added geospatial annotation (drawing) tools, including open (polyline) and closed (polygon) line drawing,
    ellipse, and rectangle drawing modes. Also allows for editing, deleting, and styling these geometric annotations.

### [v1.1.0](https://github.com/mssfoobar/gis/releases/tag/gis-web%2Fv1.1.0)

#### Minor Changes

-   807a42c: Proper Keycloak backchannel communication support for authentication/login flow - access token, refresh token, and code verifier cookies use a prefix to namespace them to avoid clashes with other web servers running in the same domain.
-   976a07c: Modified the RTUS integration to use the new `json-map` feature, which allows JSON objects to be filtered.
-   51133f5: Added interaction and rendering support for point geometries.
-   807a42c: Updated to web-base for headerbar and sidebar and code quality improvements

#### Patch Changes

-   807a42c: Improved documentation and made PUBLIC_DOMAIN optional.
-   807a42c: Updated sidebar to match web-base's sidebar, fixes overlap issue.
-   807a42c: Removed MAPTILER as a depedency.
-   807a42c: Fixed CI using incorrect env var "GITHUB_ACCESS_TOKEN" instead of "GITHUB_TOKEN"
-   807a42c: Refactored GIS page load into `api.ts` file.
-   807a42c: Fixed entity providers not rendering correct when multiple kinds are added.

### [v1.0.0](https://github.com/mssfoobar/gis/releases/tag/gis-web%2Fv1.0.0)
