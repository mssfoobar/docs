# Overview

This section provides instruction on how to set up local development environment for Workflow Engine module.

THe `Docker Compose` file to start up `UCS` module can be found under `ucs` directory in `dev-containers`
repository. For more information on `dev-containers`, please refer to
[Local Development](../../get-started/local-development.mdx).

This is needed by SFU server to listen on port 5000 and client browser from ur local machine to establish webrtc
connection for video/audio streaming.

To run UCS module, navigate to the `dev-containers` directory in your local machine and execute the following:

```bash
podman compose --env-file .env -f ucs/compose.yml up -d
```
