# Client SDK

UCS backend is built using [Ion](https://github.com/ionorg/ion) which is compatible with their Client SDKs.
- [Javascript SDK](https://github.com/ionorg/ion-sdk-js)
- [Flutter SDK](https://github.com/ionorg/ion-sdk-flutter)

Since they both have similar APIs, Javascript SDK is used in this documentation as an example.

## Installation

```bash
npm install ion-sdk-js
```

## Usage

```js
import Ion from "ion-sdk-js/lib/connector";

// this connector object is used to create websocket connection to Signal server
let connector = new Ion.Connector("http://ucs-signal.${DEV_DOMAIN}:5551", token);

// create room websocket for join, leave, send message
let room = new Ion.Room(connector);

// join a room
room.join( { sid: sid, uid: uid }, '')

// create rtc websocket for WebRTC ICE and SDP exchange
let rtc = new Ion.Rtc(connector);

// start a WebRTC session
rtc.join(sid, uid);

// handle peer events such as JOIN, LEAVE, UPDATE
room.onpeerevent = (peerevent) => {
    console.log(peerevent)
}

// send a message
let msg = {
    uid: uid,
    name: "John Doe",
    text: "Hello",
    attachment: { // leave this empty if there is no attachment
        name: "photo.jpeg",
        size: 100, // in bytes
        content_type: "image/jpeg",
        file_id: "1234" // set this to the file ID from the response of `/participant/room/:room_id/upload` API
    }
}
let payload = new Map();
payload.set('msg', msg);
room.messages(sid, uid, "all", 'Map', map)

// handle on message event
room.onmessage = (msg) => {
   console.log(msg)
}

// stream local media to the room
Ion.LocalStream.getUserMedia({audio: true, video: true})
    .then(stream => {
        rtc.publish(stream);
    });

// handle remote stream from other peers
rtc.ontrack = (track, stream) => {
    console.log("got ", track.kind, " track", track.id, "for stream", stream.id);
}
```

## Example

There is a jsfiddle example that you can play with to see how this Client SDK works. You can access the fiddle
[here](https://jsfiddle.net/elzdar/z9jar01v/32/).

To try it out, fill in the input fields with:
- signalURL - Signal server URL
:::tip
If you are running UCS locally using Quickstart guide, this should be `http://ucs-signal.${DEV_DOMAIN}`.
:::
- roomID - ID of the room created with `POST /room` API
- userID - ID of the participant in the room
- token - Access token of the participant

After that click the join button. If successful, the button should be greyed out and now you can start chatting with
other users using Message textfield and click send to send message. Other users in the room should receive the message.

To test video/audio streaming. Click on publish(Webcam) in 1st user tab. Your 2nd user should receive the audio and
video streaming. In 2nd user tab, click on publish(screen) to share 2nd user screen to 1st user. (since you are testing
in same machine. you can not have multiple publish(webcam) at the same time. This is due to your webcam is already in
used. That is why 2nd user share screen instead of webcam)

If you want to add more users, u can continue adding. They should receive the same tracks shared by user 1 and 2.
