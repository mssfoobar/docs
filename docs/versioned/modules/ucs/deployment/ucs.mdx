# UCS

Deployment configurations of the UCS components are up to the project to configure and deploy to suitable environment.
This section highlight the considerations that need to be taken when deploying UCS module.

## Configuring for Production

### Securing Endpoints

Only the following endpoints should be exposed to the public internet via ingress controller:

-   Signal (websocket)
-   Room-Mgmt (HTTP)
-   SFU (udp)

The rest of the endpoints should only be exposed to the internal network.

### TLS Configuration

Signal service should be configured to use TLS. See
[Signal Configuration](../configuration/signal.mdx) section for more details.

### SFU behind NAT

Most likely, the SFU service will be deployed behind a NAT. In this case, you should configure dedicated load
balancer for the SFU service and use the public IP address of the load balancer as the external address for the SFU
service. To do this, you can use the following configuration:

```toml
[webrtc.candidate]
nat1to1 = ["127.0.0.1"] # The public IP address of the load balancer
icelite = true # Use ICE-lite when there is no NAT traversal
```

Refer to [SFU Configuration](../configuration/sfu.mdx) section for more details.

### S3 Compatible Storage

UCS module uses Minio as S3 compatible storage. You can switch to another S3 compatible storage if needed. When
setting the Minio endpoint in [Room-Mgmt configuration](../configuration/room-mgmt.mdx), make sure the
endpoint is publicly accessible to ensure generated presigned URLs are accessible by clients.
