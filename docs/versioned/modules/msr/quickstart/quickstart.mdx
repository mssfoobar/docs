# Quickstart

This guide will walk you through the process of setting up and using the MSR (Multi-Session Replay) module to record and replay your first session.

## Prerequisites

- You have a running instance of the AGIL Ops Hub platform.
- You have administrator access to the platform.
- You have a web application that you want to record.

## 1. Deploy the MSR Module

First, you need to deploy the MSR backend server and replay UI. You can do this by following the instructions in the [deployment guide](../deployment/deployment.mdx).

## 2. Integrate the Recording Agent

Next, integrate the MSR recording agent into your web application by following the [agent integration guide](../development/agent_integration.mdx).

## 3. Record a Session

Once the agent is integrated, simply use your web application as a normal user would. The agent will automatically record your session in the background.

## 4. Replay the Session

After you have finished your session, navigate to the MSR replay UI. You should see your recorded session in the list. Click on the session to open the replay player. You can now watch a high-fidelity replay of your session.
