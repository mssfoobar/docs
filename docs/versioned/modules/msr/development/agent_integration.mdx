# Agent Integration

This guide explains how to integrate the MSR (Multi-Session Replay) recording agent into your web application.

## Installation

The MSR recording agent is available as an npm package. To install it, run the following command in your project's root directory:

```bash
npm install @mssfoobar/msr-agent
```

## Initialization

To start recording sessions, you need to initialize the agent in your application's entry point (e.g., `main.ts` or `index.js`).

```javascript
import { MsrAgent } from '@mssfoobar/msr-agent';

const agent = new MsrAgent({
  backendUrl: 'http://msr-backend:8080',
  // Other configuration options...
});

agent.start();
```

## Custom Events

You can add custom events to the recording to mark specific points in the user's journey.

```javascript
agent.addEvent({
  name: 'item_added_to_cart',
  details: {
    itemId: '12345',
    price: 99.99,
  },
});
```
