This document explains the key concepts, architectural patterns, and terminology used in the MSR (Multi-Session Replay) module.

<caption class="diagram">MSR Architecture Overview</caption>

The MSR module is built around a **Change Data Capture (CDC)** architecture that allows developers to record database table states and replay them at any point in time. This approach enables detailed After Action Reviews (AARs) by providing complete historical visibility into system state changes.

## Change Data Capture (CDC)

**Change Data Capture** is the foundational pattern used by MSR to track historical state changes. Unlike Event Sourcing, CDC is minimally invasive and can be retrofitted onto existing systems without architectural changes.

### Key Characteristics

- **Non-invasive**: CDC acts as an external observer, monitoring database transaction logs
- **Source of truth**: The primary database remains the definitive source for current state
- **Historical accuracy**: Provides an unassailable record of what data changed and when
- **Broad compatibility**: Can be applied to existing state-based systems

## Session Management

### Session

A **session** in MSR represents a replay instance where users can view system state at a specific point in time. Sessions are managed to balance system resources and user experience.

### Session Lifecycle

- **Creation**: Users request a new session to replay historical data
- **Active**: Session is actively being used for data replay
- **Inactive**: Session is idle but still consuming resources
- **Terminated**: Session is closed and resources are freed

### Session Limits

The system enforces limits on concurrent sessions:

- **MAX_ACTIVE_SESSIONS**: Global limit on total active sessions
- **Queuing**: New requests are queued when limits are reached
- **Resource Management**: Automatic cleanup of idle sessions

## Data Storage and Management

### TimescaleDB Integration

MSR leverages **TimescaleDB** as its time-series database backend, providing:

- **Hypertables**: Automatic partitioning of data into time-based chunks
- **Performance**: Optimized for high-volume time-series data ingestion
- **SQL Compatibility**: Full PostgreSQL feature set with time-series enhancements

### Data Structure

#### CDC Events Table
Stores the raw stream of change events captured by Debezium:

```sql
CREATE TABLE msr.cdc_event (
    entity_id TEXT,
    entity_state JSONB,
    op CHAR(1), -- 'c', 'r', 'u', 'd'
    event_timestamp TIMESTAMPTZ
);
```

#### Entity Snapshots (Continuous Aggregates)
Provides baseline states at regular intervals to optimize state reconstruction:

```sql
CREATE MATERIALIZED VIEW msr.entity_snapshots
WITH (timescaledb.continuous) AS
SELECT 
    time_bucket('1 hour', event_timestamp) AS snapshot_time,
    entity_id,
    last(entity_state, event_timestamp) AS entity_state,
    last(op, event_timestamp) AS op
FROM msr.cdc_event
GROUP BY snapshot_time, entity_id;
```

## State Reconstruction

### Point-in-Time Reconstruction

The core capability of MSR is reconstructing the complete system state at any historical timestamp. This process combines:

1. **Latest Snapshot**: Most recent baseline before target time
2. **Delta Events**: All changes between snapshot and target time
3. **State Merging**: Combining baseline with deltas for final state

<caption class="diagram">Snapshot Reconstruction Process</caption>

### Reconstruction Algorithm

The state reconstruction follows this logic:

1. **Find Latest Snapshot**: Locate the most recent snapshot before target timestamp
2. **Collect Delta Events**: Gather all change events since the snapshot
3. **Apply Changes**: Use `DISTINCT ON` to get the latest state for each entity
4. **Filter Deletions**: Remove entities marked as deleted (`op = 'd'`)

## Data Lifecycle Management

### Retention Policies

MSR implements automated data lifecycle management:

- **Raw Data Retention**: Short-term storage (e.g., 30 days) for detailed events
- **Snapshot Retention**: Long-term storage (e.g., years) for aggregated data
- **Chunk-Level Operations**: Efficient bulk operations on time-based chunks

### Compression

TimescaleDB's native compression provides:

- **Storage Savings**: Often >90% reduction in storage requirements
- **Query Performance**: Improved analytical query performance
- **Automatic Management**: Policy-driven compression of older data

## Frontend Architecture

### Stateless Backend, Stateful Frontend

MSR employs a unique architecture where:

- **Backend**: Stateless services that reconstruct state on-demand
- **Frontend**: Maintains session state and manages user interactions
- **Benefits**: Improved scalability, simplified session management, enhanced user experience

### Web Worker Integration

For performance optimization, MSR uses Web Workers to:

- **Offload Processing**: Move heavy state management off the main UI thread
- **Maintain Responsiveness**: Keep user interface smooth during data processing
- **Handle Large States**: Manage memory-intensive operations efficiently

## Integration Components

### Debezium Source Connector

Monitors source databases and captures change events:

- **PostgreSQL Connector**: Reads from transaction logs using `pgoutput`
- **Kafka Integration**: Streams events to Kafka topics
- **Transformation**: Applies Single Message Transforms (SMT) for data formatting

### JDBC Sink Connector

Processes Kafka events and stores them in MSR database:

- **Batch Processing**: Optimized batch inserts for performance
- **Data Transformation**: Formats events for TimescaleDB storage
- **Error Handling**: Robust retry mechanisms and error recovery

## Entity Types and Operations

### Entity Operations

MSR tracks four types of database operations:

- **`c` (Create)**: New entity insertion
- **`r` (Read)**: Initial state capture (from snapshots)
- **`u` (Update)**: Entity modification
- **`d` (Delete)**: Entity removal

### Entity State Format

Entities are stored as JSONB objects containing:

- **Metadata**: Creation time, user information, tenant data
- **Business Data**: Application-specific entity properties
- **Geospatial Data**: Location information (for GIS integration)
- **Versioning**: Optimistic concurrency control locks
