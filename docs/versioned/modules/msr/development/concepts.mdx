# Concepts

This document explains the key concepts and terminology used in the MSR (Multi-Session Replay) module.

## Session

A session represents a single, continuous period of user activity within an application. A session starts when a user opens the application and ends when they close it or after a period of inactivity.

## Recording

A recording is the captured data from a session. It includes user interactions (clicks, keystrokes), DOM mutations, network requests, and console logs. Recordings are stored securely in the MSR backend.

## Replay

A replay is the process of reconstructing and visualizing a recorded session. The MSR replay UI provides a high-fidelity, video-like experience that allows you to see exactly what the user saw and did.

## Multi-Session Correlation ID

A multi-session correlation ID is a unique identifier that is used to link multiple sessions together. This is useful for tracing a user's journey across different applications or services in a distributed system.
