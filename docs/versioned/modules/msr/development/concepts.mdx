# Concepts

This document explains the key concepts and terminology used in the MSR (Multi-Session Replay) module.

## Session

- A session represents a single, continuous period of user activity within an application. A session starts when a user opens the application and ends when they close it or after a period of inactivity.
- Each session is associated with a specific user, and by default, a user can have only one active session at a time.
- The system enforces a global limit on the total number of active sessions, controlled by the `MAX_ACTIVE_SESSIONS` setting in the configuration table.
If the number of active sessions reaches this limit, new session requests are queued, and users must wait for a slot to become available before starting a new session.

## Recording

A recording is the captured data from a session. It includes user interactions (clicks, keystrokes), DOM mutations, network requests, and console logs. Recordings are stored securely in the MSR backend.

## Replay

A replay is the process of reconstructing and visualizing a recorded session. The MSR replay UI provides a high-fidelity, video-like experience that allows you to see exactly what the user saw and did.

## Multi-Session Correlation ID

A multi-session correlation ID is a unique identifier that is used to link multiple sessions together. This is useful for tracing a user's journey across different applications or services in a distributed system.
