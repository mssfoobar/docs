# Deployment

This document provides guidance on deploying the MSR (Multi-Session Replay) module. A successful deployment consists of the MSR backend server, the recording agent integrated into your applications, and the replay UI.

## Deployment Artifacts

- **Backend Server**: `ghcr.io/mssfoobar/msr/msr-backend:v1.0.0`
- **Recording Agent**: `@mssfoobar/msr-agent@v1.0.0`
- **Replay UI**: `ghcr.io/mssfoobar/msr/msr-ui:v1.0.0`

Please refer to the [configuration section](../configuration/configuration.mdx) for details on how to configure these components.

## Dependencies

The MSR module requires the following dependencies to be available:

- A **PostgreSQL** database for storing session metadata.
- An **S3-compatible object store** for storing session recordings (if using S3 storage).
- **IAMs** for authentication and authorization.

## Deployment Diagram

A deployment diagram will be added here to illustrate the architecture and network connections between the different components of the MSR module and its dependencies.

*This is a placeholder document. Please refer to the MSR module's source code and deployment guides for detailed deployment instructions.*
