# Deployment

This document provides guidance on deploying the MSR (Multi-Session Replay) module. A successful deployment consists of the MSR backend server, the recording agent integrated into your applications, and the replay UI.

## Deployment Artifacts

- **Backend Server**: `ghcr.io/mssfoobar/msr/msr-app:v1.0.0`
- **Recording Agent**: `@mssfoobar/msr-agent@v1.0.0`
- **Replay UI**: `ghcr.io/mssfoobar/msr/msr-ui:v1.0.0`

Please refer to the [configuration section](../configuration/configuration.mdx) for details on how to configure these components.

## Dependencies

The MSR module requires the following dependencies to be available:

- **PostgreSQL**: A relational database used to store session metadata and event data for replay.
- **IAMs**: Provides authentication and authorization for secure access to the MSR.
- **Redpanda**: A Kafka-compatible streaming platform that ingests, stores, and delivers event streams for replay and further processing.
- **Kafka Connect**: Captures and streams change data (CDC) from PostgreSQL to Redpanda, enabling real-time event processing.
Utilizes source connectors (PostgreSQL) to read changes from databases and sink connectors to deliver data to MSR database.

## Deployment Diagram

A deployment diagram will be added here to illustrate the architecture and network connections between the different components of the MSR module and its dependencies.

*This is a placeholder document. Please refer to the MSR module's source code and deployment guides for detailed deployment instructions.*
