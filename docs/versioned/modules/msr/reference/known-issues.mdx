# Known Issues

This document lists the known issues and limitations of the MSR (Multi-Session Replay) module.

- **Performance degradation on complex applications**: The recording agent may cause a noticeable performance degradation on very complex web applications with a large number of DOM mutations.
- **Incomplete recordings for some SPAs**: In some single-page applications (SPAs), the recording agent may not capture all state changes correctly, leading to incomplete or inaccurate replays.
- **Limited support for WebGL**: The recording agent has limited support for recording WebGL content. Replays of WebGL-heavy applications may not be accurate.

*This is a placeholder document. This list will be updated as new issues are identified and resolved.*
