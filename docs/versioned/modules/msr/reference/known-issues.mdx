# Known Issues

This document lists the known issues and limitations of the MSR (Multi-Session Replay) module.

## Sessions are not cleaned up automatically

Users have no incentive to close sessions since the replay state is not persisted on the backend, this inevitably leads
to session exhaustion. There is no reliable way to detect if a session is still being used by a client, and no reliable
way to trigger a session close from the client side when the user closes the browser tab or navigates away.

The simplest solution is to implement session timeouts, and/or user prompts to encourage closing inactive sessions.
