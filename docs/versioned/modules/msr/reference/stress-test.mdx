# Performance Testing

## Stress test

This stress test evaluates the performance and scalability of the MSR (Message State Replay) API under varying data loads. The testing focuses on the replay/state endpoint's ability to handle increasing volumes of unique entities while maintaining acceptable response times and resource utilization.

- Script to bump data: [bump_cdc_events.sql](@site/static/sql/msr/bump_cdc_events.sql)

### Test Methodology

- Data is incrementally loaded using a script that adds 11k unique entities per execution
- The msr-database service is stopped between API calls to prevent caching effects
- Each test scenario is executed 3 times for consistency
- Performance metrics include API response time, payload size, refresh job duration, and direct database query execution time

### Summary results:

- SQL stmt to get replay/state is working fine (execute directly in database)
- **refresh_snapshot** is functioning well, within acceptable limits.
- API replay/state **is having performance issue** related to construction http response

### Resource recommendations

#### Minimum Production Resources
```yaml
resources:
  requests:
    cpu: "50m"
    memory: "128Mi"
  limits:
    cpu: "100m"
    memory: "1024Mi"
```

#### Recommended for 100k+ entities
```yaml
resources:
  requests:
    cpu: "100m"
    memory: "256Mi"
  limits:
    cpu: "500m"
    memory: "2048Mi"
```

### Stress testing procedures

#### Prepare test data
```bash
# Edit bump_cdc_events.sql to generate larger batches: set p_total_days, p_runs_per_day, p_unique_entities_total (example: p_total_days := 1, p_runs_per_day := 1, p_unique_entities_total := 100000)
# Run the script
psql -h $DB_HOST -p $DB_PORT -U <username> -d <database> -f ./docs/bump_cdc_events.sql
```

#### Test Scenario 1: Baseline Performance (10k entities)

**Objective**: Establish baseline performance with minimal data

**Steps**:

1. **Prepare test data**:
2. **Refresh snapshot** (if using snapshot system):
   ```sql
   SELECT msr.refresh_earliest_snapshot();
   ```

3. **Stop and restart database if needed** (to clear caches):
   ```bash
   # Local environment
   podman stop msr-database
   podman start msr-database

   # Kubernetes
   kubectl delete pod -n <namespace> <msr-database-pod>
   ```

4. **Execute API test**:
   ```bash
   # Time the API call
   time curl -w "\nHTTP Status: %{http_code}\nTotal Time: %{time_total}s\nSize: %{size_download} bytes\n" \
     -H "Authorization: Bearer $TOKEN" \
     "$API_URL/replay/state?timestamp=$(date -u +%Y-%m-%dT%H:%M:%SZ)"
   ```

5. **Execute direct database query** (for comparison):
   ```sql
   \timing on
   SELECT * FROM msr.entity_last_states
   WHERE snapshot_time <= NOW();
   ```

6. **Record results**:
   - API response time: _______
   - API payload size: _______
   - Database query time: _______
   - Refresh job duration: _______
   - Memory usage (peak): _______
   - CPU usage (peak): _______

7. **Repeat 3 times** for consistency

#### Test Scenario 2: Medium Load (22k-60k entities)

**Objective**: Test performance under moderate data volumes

**Steps**:

1. **Add more test data**
2. **Verify entity count**:
   ```sql
   SELECT COUNT(DISTINCT entity_id) FROM msr.cdc_event;
   ```

3. **Repeat Test Scenario 1 steps 2-7**

4. **Continue adding data** in 11k increments until reaching 60k entities

5. **Record results at each increment** (22k, 33k, 44k, 55k, 60k)

#### Test Scenario 3: High Load (100k entities)

**Objective**: Test performance at expected production scale

**Steps**:

1. **Add test data to reach 100k entities**
2. **Monitor resource usage during data generation**:
   ```bash
   # In separate terminal, monitor continuously
   watch -n 2 'kubectl top pods -n <namespace> | grep msr'
   ```

3. **Repeat Test Scenario 1 steps 2-7**

4. **Check for error conditions**:
  - Out of memory errors
  - Connection timeouts
  - Database connection pool exhaustion

#### Test Scenario 4: Stress Test (200k+ entities)

**Objective**: Identify breaking points and resource limits

**Warning**: This test may cause service degradation or failure. Only run in non-production environments.

**Steps**:

1. **Increase resource limits** (if possible):
   ```yaml
   resources:
     limits:
       memory: "2048Mi"
       cpu: "500m"
   ```

2. **Generate large dataset**:
   ```sql
   -- Edit bump_cdc_events.sql
   -- Set p_unique_entities_total := 200000
   \i docs/bump_cdc_events.sql
   ```

3. **Repeat Test Scenario 1 steps 2-7**

4. **Monitor for failures**:
   ```bash
   # Watch logs in real-time
   kubectl logs -f -n <namespace> <msr-app-pod>

   # Watch for pod restarts
   kubectl get events -n <namespace> --watch
   ```

5. **Document failure modes**:
   - At what entity count did failures occur?
   - What was the failure type? (OOM, timeout, crash)
   - What were resource metrics at failure?

#### Test Scenario 5: Concurrent User Load

**Objective**: Test multi-session performance

 **Example**: Create concurrent API requests:
   ```bash
   # Simple concurrent test with curl
   for i in {1..5}; do
     curl -H "Authorization: Bearer $TOKEN" \
       "$API_URL/replay/state?timestamp=<timestamp_in_RFC3339_format>" \
       > /tmp/response_$i.json &
   done
   wait
   ```


#### Cleanup Test Data

After testing, clean up test data:

```sql
-- Delete test data (be careful!)
DELETE FROM msr.cdc_event
WHERE entity_id LIKE '%test%'
  OR event_timestamp > '<test-start-time>';

-- Vacuum to reclaim space
VACUUM FULL msr.cdc_event;

-- Reset snapshot
SELECT msr.refresh_earliest_snapshot();
```

### Troubleshooting stress tests

#### Issue: API Response Much Slower Than Direct DB Query

**Symptoms**: Database query returns in < 10s, but API takes > 30s

**Diagnosis**:
```sql
-- Enable query logging
SET log_min_duration_statement = 0;

-- Check for serialization overhead
EXPLAIN ANALYZE SELECT * FROM msr.entity_last_states;
```

**Solutions**:
- Investigate JSON serialization performance
- Check for memory allocation issues in application code
- Review HTTP response construction logic
- See Performance Troubleshooting Guide for details

#### Issue: Out of Memory Errors

**Symptoms**: Application crashes or pod restarts during large requests

**Diagnosis**:
```bash
# Check OOM kills
kubectl describe pod <msr-app-pod> | grep -i oom

# Check memory usage trends
kubectl top pod <msr-app-pod>
```

**Solutions**:
- Increase memory limits
- Implement response streaming
- Add pagination to API endpoints
- Optimize data structures in application code

#### Issue: Database Connection Pool Exhaustion

**Symptoms**: "Too many connections" errors during concurrent tests

**Diagnosis**:
```sql
-- Check active connections
SELECT count(*) FROM pg_stat_activity
WHERE datname = current_database();

-- Check connection limits
SHOW max_connections;
```

**Solutions**:
- Tune connection pool settings
- Implement connection retry logic
- Add connection monitoring/alerts
- Scale database horizontally if needed

---

### Performance Trends

#### Response Time vs. Concurrency

| Threads | Avg Response Time | Success Rate |
|---------|------------------|--------------|
| 1 | 2.0s | 100% |
| 5 | 5.8s | 100% |
| 25 | 35.0s | 100% |
| 50 | 35.0s | 100% |

#### Key Findings

1. **Linear Degradation:** Response times increased significantly as concurrent users increased, showing non-linear degradation beyond 5 users.

2. **Stability Threshold:** The system remained stable up to 5 concurrent users with 100% success rate and acceptable response times.

3. **Critical Load Point:** At 25 concurrent users, the system began experiencing failures (16% error rate), indicating this is near the critical load threshold.

4. **Response Size Impact:** The large response payload (~5.86 MB) significantly impacts performance under load, contributing to extended response times.

5. **Connection Stability:** Connection establishment times remained relatively stable across all test scenarios (138 ms - 480 ms), indicating network layer stability.

### Recommendations

#### Performance Improvements

1. **Connection Pooling:** Ensure proper database and HTTP connection pooling to handle concurrent requests efficiently.

2. **Resource Scaling:** Current performance suggests the system may need vertical or horizontal scaling to support more than 5-10 concurrent users effectively.

3. **Timeout Configuration:** Review and adjust timeout settings, particularly for requests approaching or exceeding 30 seconds.

4. **Load Balancing:** Consider implementing load balancing if not already in place to distribute traffic across multiple instances.

#### Monitoring

1. **Set SLA Targets:** Based on these results, establish clear Service Level Agreements (e.g., 95% of requests complete within 5 seconds for up to 5 concurrent users).

2. **Alerting:** Implement monitoring and alerting for:
   - Response times exceeding 10 seconds
   - Error rates above 5%
   - Server resource utilization (CPU, memory, network)

3. **Continuous Testing:** Establish regular load testing schedule to track performance trends over time.

### Conclusion

The MSR application API demonstrates stable performance under low concurrency (1-5 users) with 100% success rates and response times under 6 seconds. However, performance degrades significantly at higher concurrency levels:

- **Optimal Range:** 1-5 concurrent users
- **Degraded Performance:** 10-25 concurrent users
- **Critical Threshold:** 25+ concurrent users (errors begin)
- **Maximum Tested:** 50 concurrent users (stable but very slow)

The system can handle high load but requires optimization to maintain acceptable response times. The large response payload size is a significant contributing factor to performance degradation under load.
