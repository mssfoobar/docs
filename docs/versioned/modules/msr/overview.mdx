# Overview

The MSR (Multi-Session Replay) module provides developers and administrators with the ability to record and replay user sessions across multiple applications. This is essential for debugging, auditing, and understanding user behavior.

## Key Features

- **Session Recording**: Capture user interactions, network requests, and console logs across one or more sessions.
- **Session Replay**: Replay recorded sessions in a high-fidelity player, providing a video-like experience.
- **Multi-Session Correlation**: Link and replay sessions from different applications to trace user journeys across a distributed system.
- **Audit Trail**: Maintain a secure and searchable log of all recorded sessions for compliance and security purposes.

## Operating Concept

The MSR module consists of a recording agent, a backend server for storage and processing, and a replay UI. The recording agent is integrated with the target applications to capture session data, which is then sent to the backend. The replay UI allows authorized users to search for and replay recorded sessions.
