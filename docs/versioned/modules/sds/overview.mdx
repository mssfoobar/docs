# Overview

A secure, backend session data store for web applications. SDS removes the sensitive state from the browser and persists
it on the server side, while keeping the lifetime of stored data strictly synchronized with the user’s IAMS/Keycloak
session.

Unlike client-side storage (localStorage/sessionStorage/cookies), SDS:
- Keeps sensitive data off the client
- Automatically expires data with the user session
- Works across tabs, devices, and micro-frontends
- Minimizes token surface area in the browser

## Key Features

- **Backend-only storage**: No sensitive data at rest in the browser
- **IAMS/Keycloak session sync**: Data expires with session idle timeout and max lifespan
- **Authenticated and temporary sessions**:
    - Authenticated sessions bind to an access/refresh token pair
    - Temporary sessions for short-lived, unauthenticated flows
- **Simple API**: simple key-value APIs for set/get/delete
- **Namespaced per session**: no data leakage across users
- **Horizontal-scale friendly**: built for low-latency access
