# Quickstart

The `Docker Compose` file to start up `Session Data Store` module can be found under `sds` directory in `dev-containers`
repository. For more information on `dev-containers`, please refer to
[Local Development](../../get-started/local-development.mdx).

To run SDS, navigate to the `dev-containers` directory in your local machine and execute the following:

```bash
docker compose --env-file .env -f sds/compose.yml --profile docker up -d
```

If you are using podman instead of docker, use `podman compose` instead of `docker compose`.

Once the services are running, you'll be able to access:

-   **Swagger UI** - `http://sds.{DEV_DOMAIN}/swagger/index.html#`
-   **HTTP server endpoint** - `http://sds.{DEV_DOMAIN}`


The `{DEV_DOMAIN}` is defined in the `.env` file at the root folder. For example, if your domain is 127.0.0.1.nip.io,
then the SDS URL will be `http://sds.127.0.0.1.nip.io`.

## Development with SDS Client Library

For development using the SDS client library, you'll need to expose the server's port 5333 by adding the following mapping to your `compose.override.yml` file:

```yaml
sds-server:
    ports:
        - 5333:5333
```

Then run Docker with the override configuration:

```bash
docker compose --env-file .env -f sds/compose.yml -f compose.override.yml --profile docker up -d
```

With this setup, the server's TCP port will be available at port 5333 on your host machine. Configure your SDS client
library to connect to `localhost:5333`.
