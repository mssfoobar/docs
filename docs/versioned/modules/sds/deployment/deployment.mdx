The Session Data Store has the following service dependencies:
- **Valkey**
    - Required by SDS for storing key-value data
- **IAMS (Keycloak + AAS)**
    - Required by SDS for authenticated session data storage

## Keycloak Client Configuration

SDS requires a Keycloak Client with the necessary service account roles to access the Keycloak admin API. Make sure you
have created a client with the service account roles shown below and provide the client credentials in the server
[configuration](../configuration/configuration.mdx#keycloak_clientid).
