# Replay Streaming

RNR relies on the SSE Client with RTUS SEH to receive real-time updates for session values and the current system time.

## Session Value

The session value contains important data that defines the state of the replay session. These values include:

- `display_status` - Represents the current status of the session. See this [documentation](../backend/session-state.mdx) for a complete list of session states.
- `replay_start_timestamp` - The timestamp marking the start of the session.
- `replay_end_timestamp` - The timestamp indicating when the session ends.
- `replay_speed` - The playback speed of the replay session.
- `replay_last_timestamp` - The last recorded timestamp in the session.

These values help update the controller status to ensure accurate session management.

Additionally, session streaming dispatches a custom event named after the display_status. This allows other modules using RNR to listen for session status updates and react accordingly.

## System Time

The system time is crucial for streaming the replay, as it determines the timeline of the replay session.
