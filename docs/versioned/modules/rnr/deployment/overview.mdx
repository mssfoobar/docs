:::important
The application modules and services in the `live` and `playback` namespaces `MUST` be deployed in isolation to prevent data conflicts and unexpected behavior.
For example, if you want to record GIS-RTUS, another set of GIS-RTUS for Playback behavior `MUST` be in different namespace.
This is to prevent the two set of services (one live, the other for playback) with same configuration competing for resources within same machine/namespace.
In some cases, there may be services trying to form the cluster if another service with same configuration is discovered. RTUS is the one such case.
