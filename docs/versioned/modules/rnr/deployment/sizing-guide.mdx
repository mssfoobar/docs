# Resource Sizing Guide

This guide provides the starting point for sizing your RNR application. Adjust the resources as needed, according to
your environment and requirements.

## Minimum Recommended Resources

Measurements are done on the EKS node group t3a.large instance type (2 vCPU, 4 GB RAM).

### RnR Recording Namespace

#### Timekeeper

Simple Service for updating system time at 1s interval.

```yaml
resources:
  requests:
    cpu: "2m"
    memory: "8Mi"
  limits:
    cpu: "5m"
    memory: "16Mi"
```

#### ScheduleJob

Service for backing up live DB and uploading backups to s3 bucket.

```yaml
resources:
  requests:
    cpu: "125m"
    memory: "16Mi"
  limits:
    cpu: "250m"
    memory: "32Mi"
```

#### TransformMsg

Service for pre-processing Debezium CDC messages. Set the maximum CPU 5 times the minimum for more headroom, if the
load is expected to grow.

```yaml
resources:
  requests:
    cpu: "100m"
    memory: "16Mi"
  limits:
    cpu: "500m"
    memory: "64Mi"
```

#### Debezium

Change-data-capture service to publish db events to nats. Sizing may be varied depending on the number of tables and
the CRUD operations.

```yaml
resources:
  requests:
    cpu: "100m"
    memory: "512Mi"
  limits:
    cpu: "500m"
    memory: "1024Mi"
```

### RnR Playback Namespace

#### ReplayMgr

Http server for managing playback session and configuration.

```yaml
resources:
  requests:
    cpu: "25m"
    memory: "16Mi"
  limits:
    cpu: "100m"
    memory: "32Mi"
```

#### MsgOp

Execute CRUD operations and RTUS API calls on playback DB and RTUS respectively. Adjust the resources according to your
expected loads.

```yaml
resources:
  requests:
    cpu: "250m"
    memory: "128Mi"
  limits:
    cpu: "500m"
    memory: "1024Mi"
```

#### DbOp

Service to restore playback DB.

```yaml
resources:
  requests:
    cpu: "25m"
    memory: "16Mi"
  limits:
    cpu: "100m"
    memory: "32Mi"
```

### Nats

Messaging service for Debezium CDC.

PVC size - 50Gi.

```yaml
resources:
  requests:
    cpu: "100m"
    memory: "2Gi"
  limits:
    cpu: "500m"
    memory: "5Gi"
```

## Example sizing based on loads

Module to record and replay - GIS.

### Storage sizing

- Storage sizing for 100k entities:
    - NATS: ~ 300MB (avg: 1 message < 3KB)
    - TransformMsg DB (including transform_message and rtus_api tables): 10MB

- Storage sizing for 12M entities:
    - NATS: ~ 36GB (avg: 1 message < 3KB)
    - TransformMsg DB (including transform_message and rtus_api tables): 1.3GB

### RnR Recording Namespace

#### TransformMsg

- TransformMsg do a hard work, so we need to give it more resources to handle the workload.
- We can set the resource request and limit to the TransformMsg container
- With total 500 entities update per sec, we can set the resource request as follows:
    -   Request:
        -   CPU: 0.5
        -   Memory: 512MB

#### ScheduleJob

- Suggestion:
    -   Request:
        -   CPU: 0.25
        -   Memory: 128MB

#### Timekeeper

- Suggestion:
    -   Request:
        -   CPU: 0.1
        -   Memory: 32MB

### RnR Playback Namespace

#### MsgOp

- The MsgOp component requires significant computational resources due to its intensive initialization and playback session processing. Resource allocation is crucial for optimal performance.
- Playback in speed 2x and 4x (500 entities update per sec in 10 mins)
    - Request:
        -   CPU: 1
        -   Memory: 3GiB

#### DbOp

- Suggestion:
    - Request:
        -   CPU: 0.25
        -   Memory: 128MB

#### ReplayMgr

- Suggestion:
    - Request:
        -   CPU: 0.125
        -   Memory: 64MB
