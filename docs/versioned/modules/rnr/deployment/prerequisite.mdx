- [k3s](https://docs.k3s.io/quick-start)
- [kubectl](https://kubernetes.io/docs/tasks/tools)

## DebeziumStream Retention Configuration

1. Install [nats-cli](https://docs.nats.io/using-nats/nats-tools/nats_cli) tool
2. Create the DebeziumStream (skip to step 3 if the stream exists)

```bash
nats stream add DebeziumStream --storage=file -s nats://{host}:{port}
```

3. Edit the stream to write to file system & limit the retention period (for example: 7 days)

```bash
nats stream edit DebeziumStream --max-age=7d -s nats://{host}:{port}
```

## Minio Object Expiry Configuration

1. Install minio client tool [mc](https://min.io/docs/minio/linux/reference/minio-mc.html)
2. Set alias to the minio server (replace placeholder in {} with your environment setup)

```bash
mc alias set {name} {minio-server-url} {access-key} {secret-key}
```

3. Use the alias created in step 2 to set the bucket expiry by day

```bash
mc ilm rule add --expire-days 7 {name}/{bucketname}
```


## Postgresql

Postgres client and postgres server should be in the same version for better compatibility.
In RnR, we use postgres client to backup and restore the live database through the `pg_dump` and `pg_restore` commands. It requires the postgres client version to be less than or equal to the postgres server version.
- If the postgres client version is greater than the postgres server version, the restore operation may corrupt the operation.
- Currently, we use the latest version of postgres client (17.5) in the RnR deployment.

## Playback namespace
- The application modules and services in the `live` and `playback` namespaces `MUST` be deployed in isolation to prevent data conflicts and unexpected behavior.
- For example, if you want to record GIS-RTUS, another set of GIS-RTUS for Playback behavior `MUST` be in different namespace.
- This is to prevent the two set of services (one live, the other for playback) with same configuration competing for resources within same machine/namespace.
- In some cases, there may be services trying to form the cluster if another service with same configuration is discovered. RTUS is the one such case.

:::info
- Playback namespace here is a namespace for playback behavior. It is not the same as the `playback` namespace in the RnR deployment, ref: [Component](../overview#components)
- The `playback` namespace in the RnR deployment is a set of services for managing playback feature. 
- The `playback` namespace in the Component deployment is a set of services (like the `live` namespace). That is the namespace where the playback process is executed.
