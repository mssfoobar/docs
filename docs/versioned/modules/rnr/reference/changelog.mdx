The following are our builds of NATS and Debezium with updated dependencies to address security vulnerabilities in older
versions. They are functionally identical to the official releases. If the latest official builds suit your needs, you
should use those instead.

## NATS

### [2.11.4-aoh](https://github.com/mssfoobar/rnr/pkgs/container/rnr%2Fnats/602960519?tag=2.11.4-aohh)

```
docker pull ghcr.io/mssfoobar/rnr/nats:2.11.4-aoh
```

## Debezium

### [3.3.1.Final-aoh](https://github.com/mssfoobar/rnr/pkgs/container/rnr%2Fdebezium-server/581834378?tag=3.3.1.Final-aoh)

```
docker pull ghcr.io/mssfoobar/rnr/debezium-server:3.3.1.Final-aoh
```

- **Breaking change**: If upgrading from Debezium 2.x, update `debezium.source.snapshot.mode` from `no_data` to `never`.
