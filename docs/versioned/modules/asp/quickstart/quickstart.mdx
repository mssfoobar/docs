# Quickstart

This guide will help you get the App Settings and Preferences service up and running quickly for local development.

## Prerequisites

Before you begin, ensure you have the following installed:

- **Go**: Version 1.24 or higher
- **Docker & Docker Compose**: For running dependencies
- **Node.js & npm**: For running setup scripts
- **Git**: For cloning the repository

## Quick Start with Docker Compose

The fastest way to get started is using Docker Compose, which sets up all required dependencies including PostgreSQL and Keycloak.

### Step 1: Clone the Repository

```bash
git clone https://github.com/mssfoobar/app-settings.git
cd app-settings
```

### Step 2: Set Up Environment Variables

Copy the environment template and configure your local settings:

```bash
cp .env-template .env
```

The default values in `.env-template` are already configured for local development.

### Step 3: Start Dependencies

Start the infrastructure services using the provided npm script:

```bash
npm run docker:start
```

This will start:
- PostgreSQL database (port 5432)
- Keycloak for authentication (configured via IAMS)
- Supporting infrastructure services

The script runs `docker compose` with the appropriate configuration files (`init/compose.yml` and `init/compose.override.yml`).

### Step 4: Initialize the Database

The database schema will be automatically initialized when the service starts. The schema is located in `schema/postgres/schema.sql`.

### Step 5: Run the Application

Start the application using the npm script:

```bash
npm run start
```

Alternatively, you can run the Go application directly:

```bash
go run cmd/main.go
```

The service will start on port `5001` (as configured in `.env`). The application automatically loads the `.env` file from the project root.

## Verify Installation

### Check Service Health

```bash
curl http://localhost:5001/health
```

Expected response:
```json
{
  "status": "healthy",
  "timestamp": "2024-01-15T10:30:00Z"
}
```

### Access API Documentation

Open your browser and navigate to:

```
http://localhost:5001/docs
```

This will open the interactive Swagger UI where you can explore and test all available endpoints.

### Download OpenAPI Specification

```bash
curl http://localhost:5001/openapi.yaml -o openapi.yaml
```
