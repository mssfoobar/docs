# Quickstart

## Docker Compose
This section provides instruction on how to set up local development environment for Attachment Management Module.

The `Docker Compose` file to start up `Attachment Management Module` module can be found under `amm` directory in `dev-containers`
repository. For more information on `dev-containers`, please refer to
[Local Development](../../get-started/local-development.mdx).

To run AMM, navigate to the `dev-containers` directory in your local machine and execute the
following:

```bash
docker compose --env-file .env -f amm/compose.yml --profile docker up -d
```

If you are using podman instead of docker, use `podman compose` instead of `docker compose`.

Once the service is up, you should be able to access the following:

-   Attachment Management API - `http://amm.{DEV_DOMAIN}`

`{DEV_DOMAIN}` is defined in the .env file at the root folder. For example, if your domain is `127.0.0.1.nip.io`, then the
value of the Attachment Management API will be http://amm.127.0.0.1.nip.io
