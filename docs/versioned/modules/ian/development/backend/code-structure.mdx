### cmd/
- Contains the entry points of the application (the main package). This is where the application is initialized and launched.

### docker/
- Stores Dockerfiles for building images for deployment.

### manifest/
- Includes deployment-related files, including Kubernetes manifests.
  - `configmap.yaml`
  - `deployment.yaml`
  - `service.yaml`
  - `ingress.yaml`

### schema/
- Stores the database schema files: sql migrations.

### go.mod and go.sum
- Define the module, dependencies, and their versions for the Go project.

### docker-compose.yaml
- Configuration file for Docker Compose, including database, services, networks and volumes.

### Makefile
- Automates common tasks: testing using `make` commands.

### internal/
Contains private application code, ensuring encapsulation
- `config/`: Mapping configurations for the application.
- `constants/`: Constants used throughout the application.
- `mock/`: Mocks for testing.
- `pkg/`: Package or third-party integrations.
- `service/`: Application service layer.
  - `entity/`: Entities for mapping database schema.
  - `handler/`: Application routings.
  - `model/`: Business data model.
  - `repository/`: Data access layer: interact database/storage.
  - `usecase/`: Business logic.
  - `service.go`: Service initialization.
