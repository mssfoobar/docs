## Vulnerabilities Highlighted by Amazon Inspector

### CVE-2025-2559

#### Vulnerable package
* org.keycloak:keycloak-services
* org.keycloak:keycloak-services

#### Severity
* MEDIUM

#### Description

* A flaw was found in Keycloak. When the configuration uses JWT tokens for authentication, the tokens are cached until expiration. 
    If a client uses JWT tokens with an excessively long expiration time, for example, 24 or 48 hours, the cache can grow indefinitely, 
    leading to an OutOfMemoryError. This issue could result in a denial of service condition, preventing legitimate users from accessing the system.

#### Mitigation

* No fix available yet from Keycloak.

* To work around, do the followings:
    * Don’t use excessively long expiration time, e.g., 24 or 48 hours for JWT token.
    * Use the default expiration settings.
        * The default expiration for Access Token is 5 minutes
        * The default expiration for Refresh Token is 30 minutes and default max session timing is 10 hours.


###	CVE-2024-9666

#### Vulnerable package
*	org.keycloak:keycloak-quarkus-server
*	org.keycloak:keycloak-quarkus-server

####	Severity
*	MEDIUM


#### Description
* A vulnerability was found in the Keycloak Server. The Keycloak Server is vulnerable to a denial of service (DoS) attack due to improper handling 
of proxy headers. When Keycloak is configured to accept incoming proxy headers, it may accept non-IP values, such as obfuscated identifiers, without 
proper validation. This issue can lead to costly DNS resolution operations, which an attacker could exploit to tie up IO threads and potentially cause 
a denial of service. The attacker must have access to send requests to a Keycloak instance that is configured to accept proxy headers, specifically when 
reverse proxies do not overwrite incoming headers, and Keycloak is configured to trust these headers.

#### Mitigation

* Possible false positive.
* This vulnerability is already fixed in Keycloak 26.0.6
    * See (https://www.keycloak.org/2024/11/keycloak-2606-released)
* IAMS-Keycloak v1.0.0 is based on Keycloak 26.0.8


###	CVE-2024-4028

####	Vulnerable package
*	org.keycloak:keycloak-admin-ui
*	org.keycloak:keycloak-admin-ui

####	Severity
*	LOW

####    Description
* A vulnerability was found in Keycloak. This issue may allow a privileged attacker to use a malicious payload as the permission while creating items 
(Resource and Permissions) from the admin console, leading to a stored cross-site scripting (XSS) attack.

####	Mitigation
* This vulnerability is considered to be of low risk as it required attacker to have privileged access to the Keycloak Admin Console and use a malicious 
payload as the permission while creating items (Resource and Permissions) from the Keycloak Admin Console.
* It is highly recommended that the Keycloak Admin Console not to be expose to the Internet.
* With IAMS, Resource and Permission are not created via Keycloak Admin Console. Instead it is created by IAMS Web Admin Console which doesn’t allow uploading of 
payload to create permission.
