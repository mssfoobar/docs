## Vulnerabilities Highlighted by Amazon Inspector

### CVE-2025-2559

#### Vulnerable package

- org.keycloak:keycloak-services
- org.keycloak:keycloak-services

#### Severity

- MEDIUM

#### Description

- A flaw was found in Keycloak. When the configuration uses JWT tokens for authentication, the tokens are cached until expiration.
  If a client uses JWT tokens with an excessively long expiration time, for example, 24 or 48 hours, the cache can grow indefinitely,
  leading to an OutOfMemoryError. This issue could result in a denial of service condition, preventing legitimate users from accessing the system.

#### Mitigation

- No fix available yet from Keycloak.

- To work around, do the followings:
  - Don’t use excessively long expiration time, e.g., 24 or 48 hours for JWT token.
  - Use the default expiration settings.
    - The default expiration for Access Token is 5 minutes
    - The default expiration for Refresh Token is 30 minutes and default max session timing is 10 hours.

### CVE-2024-9666

#### Vulnerable package

- org.keycloak:keycloak-quarkus-server
- org.keycloak:keycloak-quarkus-server

#### Severity

- MEDIUM

#### Description

- A vulnerability was found in the Keycloak Server. The Keycloak Server is vulnerable to a denial of service (DoS) attack due to improper handling
  of proxy headers. When Keycloak is configured to accept incoming proxy headers, it may accept non-IP values, such as obfuscated identifiers, without
  proper validation. This issue can lead to costly DNS resolution operations, which an attacker could exploit to tie up IO threads and potentially cause
  a denial of service. The attacker must have access to send requests to a Keycloak instance that is configured to accept proxy headers, specifically when
  reverse proxies do not overwrite incoming headers, and Keycloak is configured to trust these headers.

#### Mitigation

- Possible false positive.
- This vulnerability is already fixed in Keycloak 26.0.6
  - See (https://www.keycloak.org/2024/11/keycloak-2606-released)
- IAMS-Keycloak v1.0.0 is based on Keycloak 26.0.8

### CVE-2024-4028

#### Vulnerable package

- org.keycloak:keycloak-admin-ui
- org.keycloak:keycloak-admin-ui

#### Severity

- LOW

#### Description

- A vulnerability was found in Keycloak. This issue may allow a privileged attacker to use a malicious payload as the permission while creating items
  (Resource and Permissions) from the admin console, leading to a stored cross-site scripting (XSS) attack.

#### Mitigation

- This vulnerability is considered to be of low risk as it required attacker to have privileged access to the Keycloak Admin Console and use a malicious
  payload as the permission while creating items (Resource and Permissions) from the Keycloak Admin Console.
- It is highly recommended that the Keycloak Admin Console not to be expose to the Internet.
- With IAMS, Resource and Permission are not created via Keycloak Admin Console. Instead it is created by IAMS Web Admin Console which doesn’t allow uploading of
  payload to create permission.

### Enabling Content Security Policies for Keycloak Login Page

Keycloak imports and runs 2 scripts to improve the user experience across browsers - `checkAuthSession` and `startSessionPolling` from their "authChecker.js" file.
At present, enabling stricter content security policies will disable these imported scripts from running, which disables the session polling feature. The
repercussion of this is that users with multiple login pages open will not automatically poll and trigger a login when one page is logged in.

This is a known issue and is being tracked by Keycloak - https://github.com/keycloak/keycloak/issues/32123, this is expected to be supported in the next milestone.

### CVE-2025-64118

#### Vulnerable package

- tar

#### Severity

- MEDIUM

#### Description

- node-tar is a Tar for Node.js. In 7.5.1, using .t (aka .list) with `{ sync: true }` to read tar entry contents returns uninitialized memory contents if tar file was changed on disk to a smaller size while being read.

#### Mitigation

- This vulnerability is fixed in `7.5.2`.

## Frontend Known Issues

> These issues are currently present in the latest version and will be addressed in the upcoming release.

### Table Truncation in Assignment Dialogs

**Description:**  
In assignment dialogs, if a row contains a very long text value without spaces, it can cause layout issues. The affected column may expand beyond the dialog's width, causing content in that column—or neighboring columns—to be truncated or hidden.

**Example:**  
In the **"Assign Group"** dialog (Tenant Admin > Assign Users), a group with a long tenant path may cause the full name to be cut off or hidden.

**Status:** Open  
**Workaround:** Avoid using excessively long values without spaces.

### Incorrect Selected State in "Assign User" Dialog

**Description:**  
In the **"Assign User"** dialog (System Admin > Manage Tenants), the bulk action toolbar may appear even when no rows are selected. This is a UI inconsistency and does **not** affect the functionality of bulk actions or assignments.

**Status:** Open
