# FAQ

## Why is my service account being denied access?

Our services use the `userinfo` endpoint to check if an access token is valid. This has the benefit of allowing the
option of your Keycloak clients to be "public access" clients - which means they do not necessarily have to have a
client secret.

However, if you do use service accounts (which requires "confidential access") - you will need to ensure that the access
token generated for your service accounts have the "openid" scope as the `userinfo` endpoint is an OIDC endpoint, and
it requires the "openid" scope to be one of the access token's claims.

See the official specifications for more information:
