# Basic Authorization

In Basic Authorization, roles are used to grant access to the Application.

Roles are created and assigned to Users. Application permit user access to specific functionality based on the roles
that are assigned to User. For example, Timesheet Application can have 2 roles; Manager and Employee. Employee will be
able to fill and submit timesheet while the Manager will be able to approve the timesheet submitted.

The checking of role will be based on the roles listed in the `active_tenant` claim in Access Token.

Typical flow for basic authorization is as follows:

![basic authorization](/img/modules/iams/development/authorization/basic/basic-authorization.png)

1. User make a request to Web App Backend.

2. Web App Backend check whether user has `Access Token` in cookies. If `Access Token` is not present, user will be
   denied access and redirect to Keycloak for authentication.

3. If `Access Token` is present, Web App Backend will then need to validate the `Access Token` to ensure it is valid.
   To check for validity of the `Access Token`, Web App Backend can use the Online or Offline Validation. See
   [Online Validation](../authentication/id-token-access-token-refresh-tokens.mdx#online-validation) and
   [Offline Validation](../authentication/id-token-access-token-refresh-tokens.mdx#offline-validation) for more
   information on `Access Token` Validation.

4. Once determine that the `access token` is valid, Web App Backend will then retrieve the roles that are assigned
   to user from the `Access Token`. Based on the roles, Web App Backend will determine whether user has the rights to
   perform the request. If user doesn’t have the required role, he will be directed to error page.

5. If has the correct role, Web App Backend can then direct the request to the Backend Services.

### Retrieve Roles from Access Token

To access the roles granted to user from the Access Token, you will need to perform the followings:

-   Split Access Token into Sections; Header, Payload, and Signature
-   Decode the payload of Access Token to JSON string
-   Retrieve the roles from the active_tenant claim in the JSON string.

Please refer to [Split Access Token into Section](../authentication/id-token-access-token-refresh-tokens.mdx#split-access-token-into-sections)
and [Check Issue Date and Expiry Date](../authentication/id-token-access-token-refresh-tokens.mdx#check-issue-date-and-expiry-date)
on how to split Access Token and decode the payload into JSON string.

After decoded the access token, you should get a JSON string with structure similar to the followings:

```json
{
  "exp" : 1721289932,
  "iat" : 1721289632,
  "auth_time" : 1721289347,
  "jti" : "a0b2a1fc-cdd8-43a4-9e95-627defac350b",
  "iss" : "http://192.168.6.44:8080/realms/AOH",
  "aud" : [ "realm-management", "account" ],
  "sub" : "b25aa224-21b2-40d7-a735-3d5f10f99146",
  "typ" : "Bearer",
  "azp" : "web-app",
  "sid" : "9774505b-835e-4729-b1d1-f11920c9284a",
  "acr" : "0",
  "allowed-origins" : [ "http://localhost:3000" ],
…
…

"preferred_username" : "tbs",
  "given_name" : "T",
  "active_tenant" : {
    "tenant_id" : "8ce3c8f2-98fa-4d06-b51c-1724c86e53aa",
    "tenant_name" : "test 2",
    "roles" : [ "tenant-admin", "Manager", "Content Creator" ]
  },
  "family_name" : "BS",
  "email" : "tbs@test.com"
}
```

To have the `active_tenant` claim available in the `Access Token`, `Select Active Tenant` required action and
`Active Tenant` Mapper need to be configured in the Realm.

Please refer to [Enable Active Tenant Required Action](../../configuration/manual-keycloak-realm-setup/required-actions.md#enable-select-active-tenant-required-action)
and [Configure Active Tenant Mapper](../../configuration/manual-keycloak-realm-setup/token-claims.md#configure-the-mapper)
on how to configure the `Select Active Tenant` required action and `Active Tenant` Mapper.
