# Quickstart

The quickstart section of your module documentation should describe the minimal setup required to quickly run and begin
doing development with your module. The following documentation below is the **actual** quickstart instructions on
how to run **this** Docusaurus docs project.

:::note
If you are simply trying to figure out how to make simple changes to existing documents - such as changing links,
fixing typos or adding a short section, you can do that by editing the markdown file directly on the web using the
`Edit this page` link at the bottom of each page.

## Pre-requisites

Please install the following programs and tools before creating your module documentation:

Recommended tools:

-   [Visual Studio Code](https://code.visualstudio.com/download)

Required:

-   [node.js](https://nodejs.org/en/) (version ^20)
-   [git](https://git-scm.com/downloads) (version ^2.47)
-   Access to the source code at https://github.com/mssfoobar/docs

## Installation and running

1. Clone the repository into a folder of your choosing:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/mssfoobar/docs
```

2. Go into the newly cloned directory:

```bash
cd docs
```

3. Get the required node dependencies:

```bash title="docs >"
npm install
```

4. Run the start command to view the Docusaurus site in development mode:

```bash title="docs >"
npm run start
```

The website should now be open on `http://localhost:3000/docs/`. Changes you make and save will be automatically
reloaded on the page.

You can now make changes and preview them locally before merging them into the

Next, we will look at how we can add a new section in the navigation bar at the top of the page.

## Create documentation for a new module

1. Choose a short unique label for your module. In this example, we're using `MNM` for (My New Module).

2. Create a new folder for your module documentation files to exist in. Most of the time, you'll want to copy this
   documentation folder and use it as a template for your new module. Change the title of the folders accordingly.

```bash title="docs"
cp -r ./docs/contributing/documentation ./docs/modules/mnm
```

3.  Set the name, position, and icon for your module:

In the `_category_.json` file for your module, set the "label" to "My New Module", and the position to the new desired
position in the sidebar.

4.  Choose an icon for your module:

        4.1. Head on over to [Lucide Icons](https://lucide.dev/icons/) and pick an icon for your module. In this example,
        I'll use the [battery-charging](https://lucide.dev/icons/battery-charging) icon.

        4.2. At the icon's page, click `Copy Component Name` to get the component name in **CamelCase** format.

        <Image img={BatteryCharging} />

        Alternatively, you can manually type the **kebab-case** format listed (`battery-charging`) to the
        **CamelCase** version (`BatteryCharging`).

        4.3. Change the `icon` property to your desired icon (BatteryCharging in this case).

#### Before modifying:

```json title="_category_.json"
{
	"label": "Documentation",
	"position": 2,
	"customProps": {
		"icon": "BookCopy"
	}
}
```

#### After modifying:

```json title="_category_.json"
{
	"label": "My New Module",
	"position": 1337,
	"customProps": {
		"icon": "BatteryCharging"
	}
}
```
