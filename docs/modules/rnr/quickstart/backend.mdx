# Backend

## Pre-requisites

### Required Services

- postgres (live db)
- postgres (replay db)
- postgres (processing db)
- nats (jetstream enable)
- minio (store db snapshot)
- Debezium (nats connector)

:::note

Debezium should be configured to capture change data event on postgres (live db).
Refer to this [document](https://natsbyexample.com/examples/integrations/debezium/cli) for how to configure debezium with nats 
or can deploy debezium by this [deployment](/docs/modules/rnr/deployment/debezium.mdx)
:::

## Running Locally

1. Clone the repository:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/mssfoobar/ar2-rnr.git
```

2. Each module have their own `{ service_name }.env.sample` file.
   Copy and remove the `.sample` in repository root directory. Provide the necessary variables inside the `.env` file.

3. Start services by go command

```bash
go run cmd/replay-manager/main.go
go run cmd/db-operator/main.go
go run cmd/msg-operator/main.go
go run cmd/transform-message/main.go
go run cmd/schedulejob/main.go
```

:::info
TransformMsg need a migration before running service by executing all sql file in `/pkg/transformmsg/db/schema`
:::
## Running with Docker

1. Install [Docker](https://docs.docker.com/desktop/install/ubuntu/)
2. Install [Docker-Compose](https://docs.docker.com/compose/install/linux/)
3. Docker [Post-installation](https://docs.docker.com/engine/install/linux-postinstall/) setup
4. Clone

```bash
git clone https://github.com/mssfoobar/rnr.git
```

5. Provide necessary environment variables in `.env` by [configuration](/docs/modules/rnr/configuration/record-and-replay.mdx) 

6. Start docker-compose

```bash
docker-compose -env-file .env up -d
```

7. Cleanup Docker

```bash
docker-compose down
```

:::warning

By this point, record & replay services will be up and running.
You can verify the service liveness by hitting at the liveness & readiness endpoint.
Even though service is alive you won't be able to start the playback session yet since there is no db snapshot to start the playback session.
Refer to this infra [deployment](/docs/modules/rnr/deployment/backup-cleanup-cronjob.mdx) on how we set up periodic backup & clean cronjob.
