# FAQ

## Crashing components cause entire application to stop functioning

We are happy to report that this long-running issue is has now been addressed with
[`<svelte:boundary>`](https://svelte.dev/docs/svelte/svelte-boundary). From v5.3.0 and up, Svelte boundaries are
available to deal with this.

We have already updated our modules to use Svelte 5 in anticpation of this feature, however, much of the existing code
needs to be updated to include these error boundaries as a best-practice.

In the meantime, you already use error boundaries prodigally. Read more about
[`<svelte:boundary>` in the official docs](https://svelte.dev/docs/svelte/svelte-boundary).

## Environment variables not taking effect when `.env` file exists

When you run the build server via `node build`, environment variables are not loaded from the `.env` file.

The `.env*` file only works during development mode (it is a Vite feature that loads the `.env` file) - if you want
to use a `.env` file in production, you'll still have to load the file via:

```bash
source .env
```

Basically, this problems might be stemming from the fact that you are equivocating `.env` files with environment
variables (they're not the same).

Make sure that the environment variables are actually set in your shell, not just that a `.env` file exists in the
same folder you are running your web server.

## The file does not exist at "..." which is in the optimize deps directory.

```text
The file does not exist at "/Users/example/web-base/node_modules/.vite/deps/chunk-4N4NC65B.js?v=4e0930e2"
which is in the optimize deps directory. The dependency might be incompatible with the dep optimizer.
Try adding it to `optimizeDeps.exclude`.
```

You can resolve this error by clearing your browser cache, or hard-reloading the current page (on Chrome browsers, with
the developer tools open, right-click the 'reload' button and click 'Empty Cache and Hard Reload'). This is a
Vite-specific issue.
