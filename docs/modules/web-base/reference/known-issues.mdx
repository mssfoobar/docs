# Known Issues

## `431 Request Header Fields Too Large`

Deleting extra unused cookies will resolve this for you.

For individual projects that combine all modules into one web server, this issue does not arise, however, in the
scenario where the AGIL Ops Hub platform is deployed in a micro-frontend-like configuration (via deploying all the
modules as separate web servers onto the same domain), you can run into this error
(`431 Request Header Fields Too Large`).

This stems from multiple web servers being deployed on the same domain, and each of these servers (which represents
its own module) has a separate namespaced cookie containing the JWT access token that gets forwarded to the same
domain. The fields being too large is due to too many large cookies being sent, causing the amount of bytes being sent
in the header to exceed server limits.

To support such a use-case (modules deployed as separate servers / micro-frontend style), architectural changes need to
take place. This is a known issue that we hope to address to support this micro-frontend-like deployment use case as we
believe being able to support it provides valuable flexibility to the platform.

## SyntaxError: Unexpected token '\<', "\<!doctype "... is not valid JSON

This error can arise when the request header is too large, other services are erroring-out and returning an error page,
that is not processable as JSON.

Deleting extra unused cookies will resolve this for you.

See [431 Request Header Fields Too Large](#431-request-header-fields-too-large).

## Unknown file extension ".css" for ... @fontsource-variable/geist/index.css

Add the `noExternal` configuration for @fontsource-variable/geist in `vite.config.ts`.

```typescript title="vite.config.ts"
import { sveltekit } from "@sveltejs/kit/vite";
import { defineConfig, configDefaults } from "vitest/config";
export default defineConfig({
	plugins: [sveltekit()],
	test: {
		include: ["src/**/*.{test,spec}.{js,ts}"],
		exclude: [...configDefaults.exclude, "src/lib/aoh/core/components/ui/*.ts"],
	},
	build: {
		outDir: "build",
	},
	server: {
		allowedHosts: [".localhost", ".127.0.0.1.nip.io"],
	},
	// highlight-start
	ssr: {
		noExternal: ["@fontsource-variable/geist"],
	},
	// highlight-end
});
```
