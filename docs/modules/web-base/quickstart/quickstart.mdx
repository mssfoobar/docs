# Pre-requisites

The following section assumes you have installed all the tools required for web development from our
[tools section](../../get-started/tools.mdx).

Before you move on, it is also **mandatory** that you read through the key technology list in our
[web technologies](/docs/overview/technologies/web.md) section and you understand the justification for each one,
especially if you're not familiar with the specific technology.

## Installation

### 1. Clone the repository:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/mssfoobar/web-base
```

:::info
If you're having difficulty accessing the repository, visit the
[access configuration's troubleshooting section](../../get-started/access.mdx#npm-error-code-e404) for help.

### 2. Install Dependencies

```bash
npm install
```

:::info
If you're having difficulty installing the dependencies, visit the
[access configuration's troubleshooting section](../../get-started/access.mdx#npm-error-code-e404) for help.

### 3. Prepare the `.env` file

The project requires environment variables to be set, with the easiest and most convenient way being through a `.env`
file - a template with all the values have been prefilled for you.

Make a copy of the template file and rename it to `.env`

```bash
cp .env.template .env
```

All the values that are filled in assume that you are using the default settings in the `dev-containers` project. These
will work out of the box as we use "nip.io", a wildcard DNS service to help with DNS resolution to the loopback address
(127.0.0.1). For more details on the configuration of the environment variables, you can visit the
[environment variable section in the configuration documentation](../configuration/configuration.mdx#environment-variables).

### 4. Starting the web server in development mode

Before you can run the web server, you'll need to have all the services it depends on started. The `Web Base` only
needs the `IAMS` services to be running.

4.1. Start the `IAMS` services in Docker:

```bash title="In the root of the dev-containers folder"
podman compose --env-file .env iams/compose.yml up -d
```

Once the `IAMS` services are up, you should be able to see Keycloak at `iams-keycloak.127.0.01.nip.io` by default. If
Keycloak is up, you can start up the `Web Base` in development mode:

4.2. Run the `Web Base` in development mode:

```bash
npm run dev
```

You're now ready to begin development!
