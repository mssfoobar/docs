When referring to different components in the `GIS`'s map (the geospatial visualization), the terms in the diagram above
will appear many times. This section servers as a glossary and explanation as to what these terms mean. These models
also having TypeScript typing in the form of types and interfaces, which can be found in the
`src/lib/aoh/gis/types.d.ts` file. Not all types are listed here as some might be still in development or
self-explanatory.

The types are namespaced with `Gis`, and many of them will have the "Map" prefix. As they are
TypeScript types, they also cannot have a space in their name, so you might see them referred interchageably here with
and without spaces (e.g. `Base Layer` is the concept and `Gis.MapBaseLayer` is the type representing it but they are
essentially often the same thing).

## `Gis Map`

The overall model that holds all the objects together. In the Svelte component, the GisMap holds the references to all
the objects and passes them to children via [Svelte contexts](https://svelte.dev/docs/svelte/context).

:::info
The TypeScript type representing this is `Gis.GisMap`.
:::

## `Camera`

What is currently being shown on the map. The view can be changed by modifying the camera's view, by passing in a
`Gis.CameraView` object.

## `Bookmarks`

Bookmarks are a collection of camera views that can be loaded to the current camera.

:::info
The TypeScript type representing this is `Gis.MapBookmark`.
:::

## `Camera View`

The structure that holds all information required to define what should be shown on the map. This includes
`Gis.EntityPosition`, `Gis.ZoomLevel`, and `Gis.Direction`.

:::info
The TypeScript type representing this is `Gis.CameraView`.
:::

## `Entity Position`

An array that contains `Longitude`, `Latitude` in [WGS84 format](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/World_Geodetic_System#WGS_84)
and optionally, `Altitude` in meters.

:::info
The TypeScript type representing this is `Gis.EntityPosition`.
:::

## `Zoom Level`

Valid zoom levels start from 0 and end at 20, see https://wiki.openstreetmap.org/wiki/Zoom_levels for a reference on how
we use zoom levels.

:::info
The TypeScript type representing this is `Gis.ZoomLevel`.
:::

## `Direction`

Direction is an array with `Pitch`, `Yaw`, and `Roll` stored as euler angles in radians. This is identical to
Cesium's [HeadingPitchRoll](https://cesium.com/learn/ion-sdk/ref-doc/HeadingPitchRoll.html#HeadingPitchRoll) as these 3
angles are compact way to store direction.

:::info
The TypeScript type representing this is `Gis.Direction`.
:::

## `Layers`

Layers are a way to logically group objects in the map. The main purposes of this grouping is to be able to:

1. Show or hide groups of objects together
2. Arrange the draw order of groups of objects

There are 2 types of layers in the Gis Map:

1. Base Layers
2. Entity Layers

Every `Gis.MapLayer` must specify a source for the `Gis.Map` to be able to load the data from.

:::info
The TypeScript type representing this is `Gis.MapLayer`.
:::

## `Base Layer`

Base layers are map layers that are typically static and covers large geographical areas. Examples of this includes
terrain, roads and streets, oceans etc.

As these base layers cover huge areas - typically countries, continents or even the entire world, distributing these
efficiently is critical and is usually handled by [map tile servers](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tiled_web_map).

Base layers can have different types of sources, elaborated below.

:::info
The TypeScript type representing this is `Gis.MapBaseLayer`.
:::

## `Source`

This source refers the source that provides the data for map base layers. At present, the two types of base layer
sources are:

-   Xyz Source
-   GeoJSON Source

:::info
The TypeScript type representing this is `Gis.MapSource`.
:::

## `Entity Layer`

Entity layers are layers of geoentities. They can also be grouped into layers to allows us to control their visible
ordering on the map, and visibility through the layer interface.

These layers' sources are defined by a map data structure, with the keys being their kind, and the values being the
geoentity ids. Meaning, entities in the entity layer are segregated by [`Kind`](#kind).

:::info
The TypeScript type representing this is `Gis.MapEntityLayer`.
:::

## `Geoentity`

Geoentities are the main model that the `GIS` works with. It is esentially a GeoJSON representation of whatever entity
needs to be displayed on the map, with attributes stored in the "properties" section of the GeoJSON.

It also contains an additional `entity_type` field to support more `GIS`-specific classifications in the future.

:::info
The TypeScript type representing this is `Gis.GeoEntity`.
:::

## `Geoentity Type`

Geoentity types are a way for the `GIS` to differentiate behaviours available for different entities. There are
currently are 4 entity types:

-   `static`

    Static entities that should not move.

-   `track`

    Entities that typically have their positions updated in real time.

-   `geofence`

    Geofence representations that can trigger events based on some rules

-   `annotation`

    Graphical overlays, for example, arrows to mark where to move

At present, these are simply reserved names as the geoentities are not processed differently based on type. These are
important to have for features we plan to add in the future.

## `Entity Render Component`

The entity render component is a Svelte component that developers are expected to supply to entity providers. This is
an essential part of how developers can specify how entities are rendered on the map.

:::info
The render component is a Svelte snippet that should be supplied to point-based geoentities.
:::

## `GeoJSON`

Geoentities are all represented with [GeoJSON](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/GeoJSON). This is the completely standard
GeoJSON format with one exception - under the arbitrary "properties" field, you may optionally specify [`Kind`](#kind).

## `Geometry Styles`

Geoentities that have geometry representations (in GeoJSON) require additional style information to describe how they
should be rendered. For example, though a line can be represented with 2 points, it still needs style information such
as thickness and colour.

Geometry styles deals with this, and contains these few simple properties:

-   `stroke`

    The colour of the stroke, following CSS colour rules.

-   `stroke-opacity`

    The opacity of lines, a number between 0 and 1.

-   `stroke-width`

    A non-negative number that represents the width of the line.

-   `fill`

    The fill colour of a shape, following CSS colour rules.

-   `fill-opacity`

    The opacity of the fill, a number between 0 and 1.

These geometry styles are associated to geoentities by their [`Kind`](#kind).

:::info
The TypeScript type representing this is `Gis.GeomStyle`.
:::

## `Geometry Interactions`

Like styles, geometry interactions are grouped by [`Kind`](#kind). For each kind, geometries can have a click and hover
callback function, which users can specify by populating the `GisMap`.`interactions` object.

:::info
The TypeScript type representing this is `Gis.MapGeomInteractions`.
:::

## `Kind`

Business entities tend to be grouped into different kinds. The `Kind` attribute is meant to simply be a name that
represents these different kinds.

For example, in the context of an airport, there might be many geoentities that are considered tracks (objects that
constantly transmit telemetry, requiring their positions on the map to be updated in real-time).

-   Airplane
-   Fire Engine
-   Tractor (Tug)
-   Patrol
-   Passenger Bus

These would all be geoentity tracks in the `GIS`, however, they should be distinguished using the `Kind` attribute.

:::info
`Kind` is available as an optional property in the GeoJSON properties, represented with
`Gis.GeoEntityDataGeoJsonProperties` and `Gis.GeoEntityFeatureCollection`
