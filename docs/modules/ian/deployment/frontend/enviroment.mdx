# Environments

The IAN frontend module uses the [web-base](/docs/modules/web-base/overview/overview.md) module, meaning most of the environment variables are inherited from there. However, there are a few specific environment variables that are unique to the IAN module, listed below:

### 3. IAN_URL
This is the internal URL for the IAN backend service.

### 5. PUBLIC_RTUS_SEH_URL
This is the internal URL for the RTUS SEH module's backend service.
