# Room Management APIs

:::info
For more comprehensive documentation, please refer to the Open API Docs.
:::

There are three sets of APIs for managing rooms based on the role of the user in the room.
- Unrestricted API
- Admin APIs
- Participant APIs

## Unrestricted API

Anyone with a valid `Access Token` can create a room.

```text title="Create Room"
POST /room
```

The user who creates the room will be assigned as the room admin.

## Admin APIs

Only the admin of the room can use the following APIs.

```text title="Update Room"
POST /admin/room/:room_id
```

```text title="End Room"
POST /admin/room/:room_id
```

The room will be ended based on the specified time left in seconds in the request body. If the remaining time is not
specified, the remaining time will be set to 0s and the room will be ended immediately.

```text title="Add Participant"
POST /admin/room/:room_id/participant
```

Only the invited participant can join the room. The ID of the participant is the ID of the user in the `IAMS` service.

```text title="Remove Participant"
DELETE /admin/room/:room_id/participant
```

```text title="Grant Participant Admin Permission"
POST /admin/room/:room_id/participant/:participant_id/admin
```

Granted participants will be able to use admin APIs.

```text title="Revoke Participant Admin Permission"
DELETE /admin/room/:room_id/participant/:participant_id/admin
```

Revoked participants will no longer be able to use admin APIs. Removing the last admin from the room is not allowed.

## Participant APIs

Anyone in the room (including room admins) can use the following APIs.

```text title="List Rooms"
GET /participant/room
```

Use this API to get a list of all the rooms that the user is added to. This will also return the room status, such as
`booked`, `started` and `ended`. Based on the status, frontend can show different UI to the user.

```text title="Get Room"
GET /participant/room/:room_id
```

```text title="List Participants"
GET /participant/room/:room_id/participant
```

When a user is in a room, use this API to get the list of participants in the room with their profile information -
`username` and `archive_room` flag

```text title="Update User Profile"
PATCH /participant/room/:room_id/userprofile
```

This should be called when the user first joins the room to set the username. To archive the room, call this API
with an `archive_room` field set to `true`. This will set the archive flag for the room. The frontend should use this
flag to handle user archiving of the room.

```text title="Get Chat"
GET /participant/room/:room_id/chat
```

Get the past chat messages in the room. For new messages, users will receive them through the client SDK.

```text title="Get Upload URL"
GET /participant/room/:room_id/upload
```

Request a signed upload URL for the user to upload a file. The file ID in the response body must be used together with
Client SDK API `Send` message to store the file ID together with chat message to allow users to download the file.
Refer to [Client SDK usage](/docs/modules/ucs/development/client-sdk.mdx#usage) section for more details.

```text title="Get Download URL"
GET /participant/room/:room_id/download
```

Request a signed download URL for the user to download a file. The message object containing the file ID will be used to
generate the download URL.
