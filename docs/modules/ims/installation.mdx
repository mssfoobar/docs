# Installation

How to install dependencies and install the incident management module.

## Web-base Integration

This module is designed to be seamlessly integrated into the web-base project using the web-base CLI installer tool.
You may fork a copy of the repository [here](https://github.com/mssfoobar/web-base) if you haven't. Otherwise, please skip this step and proceed on.

## Installing the Incident Management Service Module

### Pre-installation

### Setting up the IMS backend service.
The ims module has to have its backend setup first before installing the module into the web-base. Please refer to this section to 
start up the backend service.

#### Environment variables
Before installing this module into the web-base project, the backend service must be set up. Please refer to this section for instructions on starting the backend service.

```
  IMS_URL=http://localhost:5001/v1/incident (url to your incident backend service)
  LOGIN_DESTINATION=aoh/ims (optional)
```

#### devDependencies
This module requires a certain set of devDependencies, therefore, please get them installed before running the project.

```bash
npm install -D zod
npm install -D sveltekit-superforms
npm install -D formsnap
```

### Installing the IMS Module via the CLI.
The web-base contains a module installer to install modules to the web-base. You may use this command to install the incident module. Running this command will download and copy over the required files over to your web-base repository, together with the dependencies installed into the package.json

```bash
npx cli install @mssfoobar/ims-console
```

### Running

You may now run in dev mode and commence your development, the ims home-page can be visited at /aoh/ims.

```bash
npm run dev
```
