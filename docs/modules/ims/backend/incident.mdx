# The Incident Object

Within the Incident Management service, an Incident serves as the fundamental unit of data. It is an object-oriented construct designed to encapsulate and store concise information pertaining to a specific occurrence.

## Comments
Post-incident attachments or what we called _comments_ allow for real-time updates and an accurate reflection of the evolving situation. By enabling users to add information after initial creation, the incident object remains dynamic, providing the latest insights for informed decision-making. Please refer to this section for more information on [comments](http://www.google.com)

## Customized Attributes
We understand that users need the flexibility to tailor the system to their specific needs. To accommodate this, we allow users to create custom attributes to build on top of the base incidents, which are defined and managed by the system administrator. Please refer to [this](./deployment//configuration.md) for more information on how customized attributes are implemented onto incidents.
