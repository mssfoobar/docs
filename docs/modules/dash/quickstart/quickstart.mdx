# Pre-requisites

The following section assumes you have installed all the tools required for web development from our
[tools section](../../get-started/tools.mdx).

Before you move on, it is also **mandatory** that you read through the key technology list in our
[web technologies](/overview/technologies/web.md) section and you understand the justification for each one,
especially if you're not familiar with the specific technology.

:::info
It is presumed that you already have a `Web Base` prepared and ready for you install modlets, otherwise, please go to the
[Web Framework quickstart section](../../web-base/quickstart/quickstart.mdx) to initialize your
`Web Base`.

It is also presumed that you are already familiar with running a local development environment, otherwise, please go to
the [Local Dev Environment](../../get-started/local-development.mdx) to prepare your machine for local
development.
:::

## Installation

### 1. CLI tool installation of `DASH` Modlet

Run the following command in the root of the `Web Base` folder.

```bash title="web-base"
npx cli install @mssfoobar/dash
```

You'll then be prompted to choose your 'root folder', use the default (current working directory).

The modlet will be installed, with the appropriate files being copied over, and dependencies will be added and copied
into your package.json.

### 2. Manual steps

:::note
The installation steps are still a work in progress, future versions of the modlet will shift all manual steps into the
CLI tool.
:::

#### 2.1 Add the following properties to your `.env` file

These default values will work if you're using `127.0.0.1.nip.io` for development, otherwise, change them accordingly.
The specifics for what each environment variable does can be found in the
[configuration section](../configuration/configuration.mdx#modlet-environment-variables).

```bash title=".env" {6,8}
...

## ==================== DASH ====================
## Please ensure that the backend services are deployed first.
# URL of the dashboard service (required)
DASH_URL=http://dash.127.0.0.1.nip.io
# URL of the tag service (required)
TAG_URL=http://tag.127.0.0.1.nip.io
```

### 3. Run the local environment required for DASH development

```bash title="dev-containers"
podman compose --env-file .env -f dash/compose.yml up -d
```

:::tip
Remeber to adjust and add the `compose.override.yml` if you're using Docker, or have other requirements like exposing
the database for direct connection from database management tool.
:::

### 4. Start the development server

```bash
npm run dev
```
