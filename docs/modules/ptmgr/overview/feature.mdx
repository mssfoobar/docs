Push Token Manager (PTMGR) is a service for managing FCM push tokens for mobile apps. Mobile apps can call this service
to persist the push token in an IAMS user profile. It is recommended to use this service in conjunction with UNH,
unless you have other means of persisting FCM tokens in IAMS user profiles.

PTMGR features:
- API to persist new push tokens in IAMS user profiles.
- API to refresh existing push tokens.
- Push token life cycle management following
[Google FCM best practices](https://firebase.google.com/docs/cloud-messaging/manage-tokens).
