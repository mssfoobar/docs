# Signal Workflow

Signaling workflow allows you to send data to workflow activity. For signal to work, the activity it is signaled to must
have a listener waiting for it. To know which activity is waiting for a signal, you can look at the `event` type of 
the activity. Currently, there are 2 events that can be used for signaling.
- `FormTaskStarted` - this event waits for the user to submit a form via signaling
- `RecoverTaskStarted` - this event waits for the user to recover the workflow via signaling

## Signal Workflow API

To send data into the workflow, make an HTTP `POST` request to
`{WFM_URL}/v1/signal/workflow/{workflow_id}/activity_name/{activity_name}` with the data you want to send in the `data`
field of the request body.

For detail usage of signal workflow, please refer to the
- [Form Activity](/docs/modules/wfe/development/Frontend%20Developer%20Guide/6_form_activity.mdx)
- [Recovery Activity](/docs/modules/wfe/development/Frontend%20Developer%20Guide/7_switch_recovery.mdx)
